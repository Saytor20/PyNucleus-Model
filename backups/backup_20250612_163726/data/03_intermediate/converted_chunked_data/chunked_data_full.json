The basic idea behind SCM is that companies and corporations involve themselves in a supply chain by exchanging information about market demand, distribution capacity and production capabilities. Keith Oliver, a consultant at Booz Allen Hamilton, is credited with the term's invention after using it in an interview for the Financial Times in 1982.[28][29][30] The term was used earlier by Alizamir et al. in 1981,[31] and Burns and Sivazlian in 1978.[32]",

This is one form of vertical integration. Yet, it has been shown that the motives for and performance efficacy of vertical integration differ by global region.[33]\n\nIncorporating SCM successfully leads to a new kind of competition on the global market, where competition is no longer of the company-versus-company form but rather takes on a supply-chain-versus-supply-chain form.[citation needed]",

Theories on risk management highlight the importance of \nidentifying risks early, systematically assessing their probability and \npotential impact, and developing customized strategies to address them \n(Cochrane, 2024; Ellis, 2024).   \n“ISO 31000 ” and “PMBOK ” offer standardized approaches, promoting \nongoing monitoring throughout the project’s lifecycle (Project \nManagement Institute, 2021; Malsam, 2024).

    "content": "Modular Chemical Plants (MCPs) represent a paradigm shift in chemical process engineering. They involve constructing plants from standardized, pre-fabricated modules built off-site. This approach significantly reduces on-site construction time and costs compared to traditional stick-built plants. Key advantages include faster deployment, scalability, and potentially lower capital expenditure. However, module transportation and site integration require careful planning. MCPs are particularly suited for remote locations or projects with uncertain market demands, allowing for phased investment.",

    "content": "Evaluating the feasibility of an MCP involves assessing technical, economic, and logistical aspects. Feedstock availability and cost are primary drivers for many chemical processes. Market demand for the plant's output and projected pricing influence revenue streams. Capital costs for module fabrication, transportation, and site preparation, along with operating expenses like utilities, labor, and maintenance, determine overall profitability. Regulatory environment, permitting timelines, and local infrastructure in regions like Africa also play a critical role in project viability and risk assessment. Supply chain resilience for both inputs and outputs is another key consideration.",
