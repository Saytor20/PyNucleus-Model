Overview

A typical supply chain can be divided into two stages namely, production and distribution stages. In the production stage, components and semi-finished parts are produced in manufacturing centres. The components are then put together in an assembly plant. The distribution stage consists of central and regional distribution centres that transport products to end-consumers.[2] Mentzer et al. suggest that at least three entities are required for there to be a "supply chain".[10]

In some cases, the operation of multiple tiers within a supply chain may give rise to additional costs, due the "profit layering", where each tier's operators add a profit margin to their costs. For example, in 2015 the UK's Ministry of Justice recognised that its lift maintenance and refurbishment contracts were let to a main contractor who then sub-contracted the work to a specialist lift contractor. The ministry avoided the cost impact of this arrangement by contracting for lift work

Machine Learning Systems Design

Machine learning systems design focuses on building scalable, reliable, and efficient systems that integrate machine learning (ML) models to solve real-world problems. ML systems require careful consideration of data pipelines, model training, and deployment infrastructure. ML systems are often used in applications such as recommendation engines, fraud detection, and natural language processing.

Key components to consider when designing ML systems include:

A modular design can be characterized by functional partitioning into discrete scalable and reusable modules, rigorous use of well-defined modular interfaces, and making use of industry standards for interfaces. In this context modularity is at the component level, and has a single dimension, component slottability. A modular system with this limited modularity is generally known as a platform system that uses modular components. Examples are car platforms or the USB port in computer

Further dimensions of modularity would be introduced by making the panel itself and its auxiliary systems modular. Dimensions in modular systems are defined as the

Industrial design studies function and form—and the connection between product, user, and environment. Generally, industrial design professionals work in small scale design, rather than overall design of complex systems such as buildings or ships. Industrial designers don't usually design motors, electrical circuits, or gearing that make machines move, but they may affect technical aspects through usability design and form relationships. Usually, they work with other professionals such as

Design, itself, is often difficult to describe to non-designers because the meaning accepted by the design community is not made of words. Instead, the definition is created as a result of acquiring a critical framework for the analysis and creation of artifacts. One of the many accepted (but intentionally unspecific) definitions of design originates from Carnegie Mellon's School of Design: "Everyone designs who devises courses of action aimed at changing existing situations into preferred

A critical component in the TEA of MCPs is the incorporation of learning curves or economies of learning.28 As multiple identical or similar modules are manufactured, the cost per module is expected to decrease due to accumulated experience, improved labor efficiency, optimized supply chains, and refined manufacturing processes. This "learning effect" can be modeled using an experience curve, often expressed as a percentage cost reduction for each doubling of cumulative production (e.g., an 85%

doubling of cumulative production (e.g., an 85% learning curve means the cost of the 2Nth unit is 85% of the cost of the Nth unit). Some analyses use parameters like a learning curve slope (α) and maximum achievable cost reduction (Rmax).28 This contrasts with the traditional "six-tenths rule" for economies of scale in stick-built plants, where cost scales with capacity to a power less than one. For modular plants, while individual modules might not show strong economies of scale, the overall

Quantitatively, while precise continent-wide figures are elusive, case studies and techno-economic analyses suggest potential CAPEX reductions of 10-30% and schedule compressions of 25-50% for specific projects. This can make a significant number of previously marginal or unviable chemical projects feasible. The ability to right-size plants to local demand can unlock numerous smaller opportunities that would be overlooked by traditional mega-project approaches.

4.2.	Overall Assessment

Modularization is not a panacea for all challenges facing African industrialization. It cannot, in isolation, resolve deep-seated issues of governance, macroeconomic instability, or fundamental gaps in education. However, it represents a potentially transformative technological and strategic tool that can significantly lower the entry barriers and alter the risk-reward profile for chemical industry investments in Africa.

MCPs offer a pathway to a more decentralized, flexible, and potentially more resilient chemical manufacturing ecosystem. This approach can empower local entrepreneurship, facilitate the development of SMEs in the chemical sector, and promote more inclusive industrial growth by enabling value addition in regions previously bypassed by industrial development. The synergy with process intensification (MCPI) further enhances this potential, paving the way for modern, efficient, and more sustainable

The successful adoption of MCPs could allow African nations to leapfrog traditional phases of industrial development22, establishing a 21st-century chemical industry grounded in agility, resource efficiency, and adaptability. This requires a paradigm shift from thinking solely in terms of large, centralized mega-projects towards embracing a portfolio of appropriately scaled and strategically located modular facilities.

4.3.	Limitations of the Study

This Systematic Literature Review, while comprehensive, has certain limitations:

Publication Bias: The review relies on published literature, which may be subject to publication bias (e.g., a tendency to publish positive results or successful case studies more readily than failures).

Content:
Data Scarcity for Africa-Specific MCPs: While efforts were made to find Africa-specific data, detailed techno-economic analyses and operational case studies of MCPs within the African chemical sector are still relatively scarce. Much of the analysis relies on extrapolating from developing country contexts or general modular principles.

increases and construction delays with safety hazards.  Despite 
frameworks like ISO 31000 and PMBOK, implementation challenges,

develops improvements in risk management by identifying fundamental 
risk types while analyzing project implementation  obstacles and 
evaluating defense measures used in big construction projects. Using a

used to analyze 107 risk descriptions, 76 challenge descriptions, and 82 
mitigation strategy descriptions. Findings indicate that "Other Risks" 
(29.0%) and Operational Risks (17.8%) dominate, with Technical Risks

1 INTRODUCTION  
Airports alongside bridges and highways define essential elements for 
modern economies and social advancement according to Mok et al. 
(2015). These nationwide projects demand considerable capital 
injections while involving intricate design work along with protracted 
construction periods as well as essential coordination between officials 
and construction firms and residential groups (Mok et al., 2015). The

Burj Khalifa reached its position as the world's tallest bu ilding by

serves as evidence for why proper risk management techniques must be 
combined with effective stakeholder coor dination (Ametller et al., 2017). 
The successful completion of projects depends on effective management 
of economic interests along with social effects and regulatory

inadequate risk management.

This study finds main hazards, makes implementation difficulties, and 
evaluates mitigation in large scale building projects. Previous works tend 
to pay less attention to environmental ri sks as well as issues such as 
stakeholder misalignment (Zou et al., 2007).  
1.1 Research Problem  
Risk management in major infrastructure developments remains 
problematic despite guidelines like PMBOK (Project Management 
Institute, 2021; Mansour et al., 2023 ), ISO 31000 (Abuyassin et al.,

2018; Sousa et al., 2012). Guidelines can prove ineffective in handling 
actual issues in various project environments (Hillson & Murray -
Webster, 2017).  Unforeseen weather conditions, supply chain 
interruptions, and political  unrest can influence timeliness and costs 
(Hillson & Murray -Webster, 2017). Poor stakeholder coordination and 
ineffective mitigation result in increased risks, such as cost overruns, 
delays, and safety issues (Hillson & Murray -Webster, 2017). Though

widely reported risk avoidance, transfer, mitigation, and acceptance 
techniques (Project Management Institute, 2021), their efficacy is 
heterogeneous owing to situational limitations, particularly in low -
income nations with weak countries (Flyvbjerg, 2017; Nawa z et al., 
2019). The present study aims for risk management techniques custom -
made for diverse project environments.

This study addresses:  
 Which risk categories are most important for major building 
projects?  
 What obstacles exist for efficient risk ma nagement?  
 Which risk reduction techniques, according to the literature, are 
the most successful?

2 THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK  
This chapter examines theoretical and empirical foundation of risk 
management in major building projects. First, we cover project 
management principles, then theories and procedures of risk

and it sizes range from little attempts like advertising campaigns to 
massive undertakings like the Burj Khalifa, which need careful planning 
(Mok et al., 2015). The distinct nature of each project brings 
uncertainties, requiring customized approaches to manage risks such as 
financial instability, changes in regulations, and conflicts among 
stakeholders (Kerzner, 2022; Malsam, 2024). Proper management

Project Manage ment  
According to (Project Management Institute, 2017, p. 570), "Project 
management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and 
techniques to project activities to meet project requirements". Large 
scale construction projects are often managed thro ugh this process of 
constraints including scope, time, cost and quality, thus in arising

The Project Triangle  
"The project management triangle is made up of three variables that 
determine the quality of the project: scope, cost, and time" (Asana, 
2025, para. 2). These factors are interconnected,  meaning a change in 
one can impact the others (for example, reducing the timeline might 
raise costs) (Morris, 2013). Project management tries to achieve 
reduction of risks, satisfy stakeholder, use the resources efficiently, and

Role of Project Manager  
The project manager oversees the project’s entire lifecycle and serves 
as the main point of contact for stakeholders (Schwartz, 2024; Bornman 
& Frisa, 2024). Their dutie s include:  
 Planning:  Writing a great project plan that covers requirements, 
estimates, budgets, and risk management plans (Schwartz, 2024; 
LetsBuild, 2023).

 Resource Management:  Ensuring resources are allocated 
efficiently to prevent delays or bottlenecks (Bika, 2022).  
 Risk Management:  Potential risks identification, assessment of 
impact and mitigation of such risks (Bornman & Frisa, 2024; 
LetsBuild, 2023b).  
 Communication:  Facilitating clear and consistent 
communication with stakeholders to avoid misunderst andings and 
conflicts (Bornman & Frisa, 2024; Bika, 2022).

2.2 Risk Management Theories for Construction Endeavors  
In fact, it is risk management, as a very important aspect of the 
construction project management, as it seeks to identify, assess and 
manage risk s that may act negatively towards the project outcomes. 
Sound risk management practices are essential to large scale 
construction projects in order to be cost effective, completed on time 
and in compliance with safety (Zou et al., 2007; Guevara, 2023; Shah ,

2025).  Theories on risk management highlight the importance of 
identifying risks early, systematically assessing their probability and 
potential impact, and developing customized strategies to address them 
(Cochrane, 2024; Ellis, 2024).   
“ISO 31000 ” and “PMBOK ” offer standardized approaches, promoting 
ongoing monitoring throughout the project’s lifecycle (Project 
Management Institute, 2021; Malsam, 2024). Tools like Project

Management Information Systems (PMIS) streamline risk management 
tasks, enhancing decision -making and improving project outcomes 
(Shah, 2025). By effectively managing risks, projects can reduce cost 
overruns, ensure timely delivery, improve safety, use resources 
efficiently, and boost stakeholder trust (Guevara, 2023; Cochrane, 
2024; El lis, 2024).

 Risk Identification:  This step identifies possible hazards by 
using brainstorming, techniq ues such as checklists, historical data 
analysis, and so forth and identifies those hazards based on the 
operational, financial, environmental and the safety threats 
(Osipova, 2007; McKinnon, 2024).

(e.g., via insurance), or acceptance are developed, tailored to the 
project’s context (Jones, 2024).

 Risk Control:  Corrective actions are implemented to address 
emerging risks, refining strategies based on monitoring to keep 
the project aligned with objectives (Graham, 2023).

ISO 31000  Framework  
The ISO 31000 provides the standardized approach of risk management 
which can be put to good use in the construction industry. Based on 
Abuyassin et al. (2018) and Sousa et al. (2012), it prioritizes early 
identification of risk, inclusion and consistency with decision making 
processes through inclusion of risk management. In construction, the 
use of ISO 31000 helps risk awareness due to which risk practices are

2.6 Challenges in Risk Management Impleme ntation  
Implementing risk management in faces several challenges:  
 Stakeholder Misalignment:  Conflicting priorities among 
owners, contractors, and regulators hinder coordinated risk 
management, leading to inconsistent strategies (Gharaibeh, 
2019).  
 Difficult ies in Communicating and Making Decisions:  
Coordinated risk management not only requires coordination

among owners, contractors, and regulators, conflicting priorities 
among owners, contractors, and regulators make it difficult to 
implement a coordinated strategy (Gharaibeh, 2019).  
 Resource Constraints:  It is important because, if there is 
ineffective communication and delayed decision making this may 
damage risk management and may also delay the project 
(Gharaibeh 2019; Construction Link 2025).

The contextual analysis, narrative inquiry and thematic exploration 
approaches (Braun & Clarke, 2006) are used to develop a detailed 
investigation of human, e nvironmental and organizational factors. This 
is consistent with the study’s aim of identifying risk types, assessing 
implementation challenges and assessing mitigation strategies, 
providing a more nuanced alternative to quantitative methods (Denzin

Identification of Key Risk Categories  
Using 107 risk descriptions from 38 research (2017 –2025), Python 
expedited the proc ess of identifying the main risk categories:  
 Text Preprocessing : NLTK preprocessed text by lowercasing,

like "in," "of"), eliminating punctuation, and lemmatizing. For 
example, “Construction cost overruns threaten economic 
sustainability”  became ['construction', 'cost', 'overrun', 'threaten', 
'economic', 'sustainability'] .  
 Keyword -Based Categorization : A dictionary linked keywords 
to eight categories —Financial (e.g., "cost"), Operational (e.g ., 
"delay"), Safety (e.g., "accident"), Technical (e.g., "design"),

Environmental (e.g., "geological"), Political (e.g., "instability"), 
Contractual (e.g., "dispute"), and Supply Chain (e.g., "delivery"). 
Risks were assigned to categories by keyword matchi ng, with 
unmatched risks labeled "Other Risks." For example, "Inflation 
rate volatility was identified as a critical risk" was classified as 
Political Risks due to "volatility."

Figure 2.  Distribution of risk categories across 107 risk descriptions  
The high incidence of "Other Risks" (29.0%) implies that many hazards 
are context -specific or do not fit into specified categories, such as 
technology hurdles (Jackson & Priya, 2024) or historical risk carryovers 
(Gao et al., 2024). This aligns with Nawaz et al. (2019), who noted 
unmanaged risks threaten project success in Pakistan.

of the study was everything one could think about dynamic risk 
management in large construction projects : 
Research Question 1:  “Which risk categories are most important for 
major building projects? ” The study identified Operational and Financial 
Risks as dominant, with Environmental Risks highlighting sustainability

concerns. An important frequency (29.0%) showed that the “Other 
Risks” were developing risks and more fully understood risk profile in 
building projects.  
Research Question 2:  “What obstacles exist for efficient risk 
management? ” The findings confirmed stake holder misalignment and 
poor communication as critical challenges, manifesting as poor 
coordination and complexity, with a lack of risk awareness exacerbating 
safety and operational issues.

safety and operational issues.  
Research Question 3:  “Which risk reduction techniques, according t o 
the literature, are the most successful?”  Contingency planning, risk 
identification, methodical frameworks, and technology adoption (e.g., 
BIM) were highlighted as useful solutions for mitigating financial, 
operational, and technical risks and encouragin g sustainability.  
7.3 Implications for Risk Management  
These findings create essential implications which affect both theory and

practical application of construction risk management.  The study 
demonstrates theoretically that adaptable risk classification systems 
must exist to detect new risks because 29.0% of the respondents 
identified "Other Risks".  Research should focus on constructing 
integrated models which address risks and challenges as complete 
systems since risk management faces these characteristi cs in practice.  
In real terms, the focus on backup planning spotting risks, and organized

methods gives useful ways to handle money and work risks. At the same 
time, BIM's part in making planning more exact and eco -friendlier  opens 
a door to update buildin g methods (Ramadhan & Waty 2025; Ahmad et 
al. 2025).  To overcome implementation barriers, practitioners must top 
their list of things to do as improving stakeholder coordination and 
awareness of risks, and also applying mitigation strategies to real 
projec ts.

7.4 Final Remarks  
The vital aspects of large-scale construction risk management were 
identified, the systemic challenges were revealed and effective 
mitigation strategy was evaluated in this study.  A key finding is that 
there are operational and financ ial risks, widespread issues of poor 
coordination and complexity, and the effectiveness of interventions, i.e. 
contingency planning, risk identification, structured approaches, and

technological adoption, namely building information modeling.  The 
research provides useful risk management practice improvement 
insights even though it faces constraints from literature -based data 
analysis and the absence of stakeholder input and its wide geographical 
range.  
By addressing stakeholder misalignment, enhancing risk awareness, and 
leveraging technology for sustainable outcomes, practitioners can 
enhance the resilience of large -scale construction projects. Future

research, as outlined in Section 7.6, should focus on incorporating real -
time data, region -specific analyse s, and advanced analytical techniques 
to address these limitations, ensuring that risk management strategies 
are both theoretically robust and practically applicable.

7.5 Limitations  
This study, while comprehensive, is subject to several limitations that 
impacted the findings and their applicability, as anticipated in Section 
1.5 and further revealed through the analysis in Chapters 5 and 6.  
First, as indicated in Section 1.5, the study's capacity to capture actual 
implementation issues was restricted by it s dependence on existing 
literature (38 sources) and a lack of real -time data or case studies. For

example, while technology adoption (e.g., BIM) was highlighted as a 
crucial mitigation technique, hurdles like as training costs or opposition 
to adoption we re not investigated, thereby overestimating its practicality 
in real -world scenarios.  
Second, Section 1.5 mentioned that stakeholder feedback was lacking, 
and hence limited the usefulness of the study’s findings.  Although 
stakeholder misalignment and its effects on risk management were

considered, further insight would have been enriched had project 
managers or contractors been directly included as a source of findings 
to these challenges (e.g. poor coordination).  
Third, Section 1.5 notes the magnitude of geography that was the 
study's focus, thereby restricting its local applicability to special regional 
types of projects. Political Risks, reported as 6.5% in Section 5.1, like 
the example "Political unpredictability delays international construction

projec ts" by Ullah et al. (2024), can differ a lot depending on the political 
environment. These include areas like conflict zones or stable regions, 
though this research did not examine such distinctions.  
Fourth, the keyword -based categorization approach result ed in a high 
proportion of "Other Risks" (29.0%), confirming the limitation noted in 
Section 1.5 that emerging risks like technological disruptions or 
geopolitical tensions may not be fully addressed. This suggests that the

capture nuanced or evolving risks, such as those related to cybersecurity 
or global supply chain disruptions.  
Fifth, the topic modeling in Section 5.3 labeled Topic 3 as "Other 
Mitigation Strategy," indicating a need for more granular themes to fully 
capture the diversity of mitigation strategies, a limitation that emerged 
during the analysis and aligns with the methodological constraints noted 
in Section 1.5.

in Section 1.5.  
Finally, the qualitative approach and focus on large -scale projects,  as 
anticipated in Section 1.5, limit the generalizability of the findings to 
smaller projects or those with different stakeholder dynamics. For 
instance, simpler approaches could be more practical for smaller 
projects with less resources, making the empha sis on methodical 
frameworks less useful. These drawbacks show that researching risk

7.6 Recommendations for Future Works  
The following suggestions are put up for further  study in order to build 
on the present findings and overcome the limitations mentioned in 
Section 7.5:  
Incorporate Real -Time Data and Stakeholder Feedback:  Future 
studies should include primary data through case studies, surveys, or 
interviews with stakeh olders (e.g., project managers, contractors) to

validate literature -based findings and capture practical implementation 
challenges. Exploring impediments to BIM adoption, such as training 
costs or opposition, might offer practitioners with practical insigh ts while 
also addressing the lack of stakeholder feedback mentioned in Section 
1.5. 
Region -Specific Analysis:  To overcome the geographical limitation, 
future research could focus on specific regions with unique conditions,

such as conflict zones or emerging economies, to assess how Political 
Risks and other categories vary across contexts. This would enhance the 
applicability of findings to diverse project environments, as suggested 
in Section 1.5.  
Advanced Risk Categorization:  The significant amount  of "Other 
Risks" (29.0%) suggests that better natural language processing (NLP) 
approaches, such as BERT, are required to increase risk identification

accuracy and catch developing threats such as technology disruptions or 
geopolitical conflicts, as indic ated in Section 1.5. Expanding the keyword 
dictionary to include terms related to cybersecurity, climate change, or 
global supply chain disruptions could further enhance categorization.  
Improved Topic Modeling: The topic modeling technique has to be 
improv ed by making themes more specific, especially when it comes to 
mitigation tactics.  For instance, distinguishing between project

Strategy" topic could provide more specific recommendations f or 
practitioners, addressing the methodological limitation of thematic 
granularity.  
Cost-Benefit Analysis of Technology Adoption:  The implementation 
of technology adoption through cost -benefit analysis (fuzzy logic and 
BIM) would demonstrate how these meth ods improve project results 
while decreasing operational risks. According to the generalizability

useful information, particularly for resource -constrained endeavors.  
Longitudinal St udies for Smaller Projects: Longitudinal studies that 
look at how well mitigation techniques —like risk identification,

Title: Mcp Basics
Content:
Modular Chemical Plants (MCPs) represent a paradigm shift in chemical process engineering. They involve constructing plants from standardized, pre-fabricated modules built off-site. This approach significantly reduces on-site construction time and costs compared to traditional stick-built plants. Key advantages include faster deployment, scalability, and potentially lower capital expenditure. However, module transportation and site integration require careful planning. MCPs are particularly

Title: Feasibility Factors
Content:
Evaluating the feasibility of an MCP involves assessing technical, economic, and logistical aspects. Feedstock availability and cost are primary drivers for many chemical processes. Market demand for the plant's output and projected pricing influence revenue streams. Capital costs for module fabrication, transportation, and site preparation, along with operating expenses like utilities, labor, and maintenance, determine overall profitability. Regulatory environment, permitting timelines, and
