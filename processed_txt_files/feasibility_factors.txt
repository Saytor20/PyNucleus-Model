Evaluating the feasibility of an MCP involves assessing technical, economic, and logistical aspects. Feedstock availability and cost are primary drivers for many chemical processes. Market demand for the plant's output and projected pricing influence revenue streams. Capital costs for module fabrication, transportation, and site preparation, along with operating expenses like utilities, labor, and maintenance, determine overall profitability. Regulatory environment, permitting timelines, and local infrastructure in regions like Africa also play a critical role in project viability and risk assessment. Supply chain resilience for both inputs and outputs is another key consideration.
