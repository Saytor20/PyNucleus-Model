The economic need for m ega-construction works including highways and 
airports results in multiple types of risks that produce both cost 
increases and construction delays with safety hazards.  Despite 
frameworks like ISO 31000 and PMBOK, implementation challenges, 
stakeholder misalignment, and emerging risks persist. The research 
develops improvements in risk management by identifying fundamental 
risk types while analyzing project implementation  obstacles and 
evaluating defense measures used in big construction projects. Using a 
qualitative approach grounded in constructivism, the research reviewed 
38 empirical sources (2017 –2025), including journals, case studies, and 
industry reports. Thematic analysis, supported by Python tools, was 
used to analyze 107 risk descriptions, 76 challenge descriptions, and 82 
mitigation strategy descriptions. Findings indicate that "Other Risks" 
(29.0%) and Operational Risks (17.8%) dominate, with Technical Risks 
(10.3%) and Financial Risks (9.3%) interconnected, and Environmental 
Risks (7.5%) emphasizing sustainability. Challenges like poor 
coordination and complexity, marked by "hinder" (25 instances) and 
"complicate" (23 instances), impede risk management. Effecti ve 
strategies include contingency planning, risk identification, systematic 
frameworks, and technology adoption (e.g., Building Information 
Modeling), addressing financial, operational, and technical risks while 
promoting sustainability. This study advocat es for integrated risk 
management to enhance coordination and risk awareness. The findings 
might not apply to specific region projects or small projects because the 
research relied on literature -based data and lacked stakeholder 
feedback while also having a wide geographical scope.  Future research 
should incorporate real -time data, conduct region -specific analyses, and 
use advanced NLP to capture emerging risks and refine strategies. This 
study offers actionable insights for resilient and sustainable constr uction 
project outcomes.

1 INTRODUCTION  
Airports alongside bridges and highways define essential elements for 
modern economies and social advancement according to Mok et al. 
(2015). These nationwide projects demand considerable capital 
injections while involving intricate design work along with protracted 
construction periods as well as essential coordination between officials 
and construction firms and residential groups (Mok et al., 2015). The 
Burj Khalifa reached its position as the world's tallest bu ilding by 
consuming more than $1.5 billion in funds with advanced engineering 
involved (Flyvbjerg, 2017). The historical project of Channel Tunnel 
serves as evidence for why proper risk management techniques must be 
combined with effective stakeholder coor dination (Ametller et al., 2017). 
The successful completion of projects depends on effective management 
of economic interests along with social effects and regulatory 
requirements and high -quality construction practices (Mok et al., 2015).  
Nevertheless, th ey still face financial unstable (e.g. budget overruns), 
operational inefficiency (e.g. delays), regulatory change, environmental 
uncertainty, and socio-political  challenges (Zou et al., 2007; Dirampaten 
& Griño, 2024). Cost overruns, delays and safety haz ards occur from 
inadequate risk management.  
While ISO 31000 as well as PMBOK frameworks exist, the insufficient 
implementation from practices such as resource constraint along 
liabilities of expertise ‘balloon’ projects to the deep end (Vargas & 
Campos, 20 22; Kumar & Kumar, 2024). Innovative solutions are 
required for emerging risks including technological disruptions and 
climate change (Dirampaten & Griño, 2024). This paper adopts a 
qualitative approach where the empirical studies and case studies (e.g., 
Burj Khalifa) and industry reports from the Project Management 
Institute (PMI) on the subject are reviewed grounded in constructivist 
and interpretivism. Evidence based findings are provided using thematic 
analysis rooted with python libraries such as (NLTK , pandas) (Braun & 
Clarke, 2006; Loper & Bird, 2002; McKinney, 2010).

This study finds main hazards, makes implementation difficulties, and 
evaluates mitigation in large scale building projects. Previous works tend 
to pay less attention to environmental ri sks as well as issues such as 
stakeholder misalignment (Zou et al., 2007).  
1.1 Research Problem  
Risk management in major infrastructure developments remains 
problematic despite guidelines like PMBOK (Project Management 
Institute, 2021; Mansour et al., 2023 ), ISO 31000 (Abuyassin et al., 
2018; Sousa et al., 2012). Guidelines can prove ineffective in handling 
actual issues in various project environments (Hillson & Murray -
Webster, 2017).  Unforeseen weather conditions, supply chain 
interruptions, and political  unrest can influence timeliness and costs 
(Hillson & Murray -Webster, 2017). Poor stakeholder coordination and 
ineffective mitigation result in increased risks, such as cost overruns, 
delays, and safety issues (Hillson & Murray -Webster, 2017). Though 
widely reported risk avoidance, transfer, mitigation, and acceptance 
techniques (Project Management Institute, 2021), their efficacy is 
heterogeneous owing to situational limitations, particularly in low -
income nations with weak countries (Flyvbjerg, 2017; Nawa z et al., 
2019). The present study aims for risk management techniques custom -
made for diverse project environments.  
1.2 Research Objectives  
The aims are: 
 To identify important risk categories for large -scale building 
projects.  
 To analyze challenges in ris k management implementation.  
 To evaluate effective risk mitigation strategies from the literature.  

   10 
1.3 Research Questions  
This study addresses:  
 Which risk categories are most important for major building 
projects?  
 What obstacles exist for efficient risk ma nagement?  
 Which risk reduction techniques, according to the literature, are 
the most successful?  
1.4 Significance of the Research  
The significan ces are : 
 Advancing Knowledge:  Enhancing understanding of financial, 
operational, and environmental risks (Flyvbjerg, 2017).  
 Practical Impact:  providing direction to improve risk 
management practices and project efficacy (Osei -Kyei et al., 
2022).  
 Improving Risk reduction Strategies:  Providing suggestions 
based on research to maximize risk reduction (Project 
Management Institute, 2021).  
1.5 Limitations of the Study  
The limitations  are: 
 Methodological Constraints : Relies on existing literature, 
lacking real -time data.  
 Geographical Focus : Lacks a specific regional focus, limiting 
applicability.  
 Risk Categories:  New hazards, such technology disruptions, 
could not be adequately covered.  

   11 
 Generalizability: Smaller projects might not be able to use the 
results.  
 Excludes stakeholder feedback, thereby restricting practical 
findings.

2 THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK  
This chapter examines theoretical and empirical foundation of risk 
management in major building projects. First, we cover project 
management principles, then theories and procedures of risk 
management, the framework analysis, identification of important risk 
categories, implementation issues and research holes.  
2.1 Project Management  
Project  
A project  is “a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique 
product, service, or result ” (Project Management Institute, 2017, p. 32)  
and it sizes range from little attempts like advertising campaigns to 
massive undertakings like the Burj Khalifa, which need careful planning 
(Mok et al., 2015). The distinct nature of each project brings 
uncertainties, requiring customized approaches to manage risks such as 
financial instability, changes in regulations, and conflicts among 
stakeholders (Kerzner, 2022; Malsam, 2024). Proper management 
ensures that projects achieve their goals while staying within limitations 
(Kerzner, 2022).  
Project Manage ment  
According to (Project Management Institute, 2017, p. 570), "Project 
management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and 
techniques to project activities to meet project requirements". Large 
scale construction projects are often managed thro ugh this process of 
constraints including scope, time, cost and quality, thus in arising 
projects risks (Project Management Institute,  2017,  p. 36). It uses 
methodologies like Agile and Waterfall, and frameworks like PMBOK and 
ISO 21500, to standardize processes ( Project Management Institute , 
2021).  

   14 
The Project Triangle  
"The project management triangle is made up of three variables that 
determine the quality of the project: scope, cost, and time" (Asana, 
2025, para. 2). These factors are interconnected,  meaning a change in 
one can impact the others (for example, reducing the timeline might 
raise costs) (Morris, 2013). Project management tries to achieve 
reduction of risks, satisfy stakeholder, use the resources efficiently, and 
follow the legality standa rds (Morris, 2013; Project Management 
Institute, 2017, p. 36).  
Role of Project Manager  
The project manager oversees the project’s entire lifecycle and serves 
as the main point of contact for stakeholders (Schwartz, 2024; Bornman 
& Frisa, 2024). Their dutie s include:  
 Planning:  Writing a great project plan that covers requirements, 
estimates, budgets, and risk management plans (Schwartz, 2024; 
LetsBuild, 2023).  
 Resource Management:  Ensuring resources are allocated 
efficiently to prevent delays or bottlenecks (Bika, 2022).  
 Risk Management:  Potential risks identification, assessment of 
impact and mitigation of such risks (Bornman & Frisa, 2024; 
LetsBuild, 2023b).  
 Communication:  Facilitating clear and consistent 
communication with stakeholders to avoid misunderst andings and 
conflicts (Bornman & Frisa, 2024; Bika, 2022).  
 Monitoring and Control:  Keeping track of progress and making 
adjustments to address any deviations from the plan (Bornman & 
Frisa, 2024; RIB Software, 2024).  
 Leadership:  Inspiring teams, encouragin g collaboration, and 
maintaining morale (Bika, 2022).  

   15 
2.2 Risk Management Theories for Construction Endeavors  
In fact, it is risk management, as a very important aspect of the 
construction project management, as it seeks to identify, assess and 
manage risk s that may act negatively towards the project outcomes. 
Sound risk management practices are essential to large scale 
construction projects in order to be cost effective, completed on time 
and in compliance with safety (Zou et al., 2007; Guevara, 2023; Shah , 
2025).  Theories on risk management highlight the importance of 
identifying risks early, systematically assessing their probability and 
potential impact, and developing customized strategies to address them 
(Cochrane, 2024; Ellis, 2024).   
“ISO 31000 ” and “PMBOK ” offer standardized approaches, promoting 
ongoing monitoring throughout the project’s lifecycle (Project 
Management Institute, 2021; Malsam, 2024). Tools like Project 
Management Information Systems (PMIS) streamline risk management 
tasks, enhancing decision -making and improving project outcomes 
(Shah, 2025). By effectively managing risks, projects can reduce cost 
overruns, ensure timely delivery, improve safety, use resources 
efficiently, and boost stakeholder trust (Guevara, 2023; Cochrane, 
2024; El lis, 2024).  
2.3 The Risk Management Process  
Five steps make up the organized method to risk identification, 
assessment, and mitigation used in construction projects:  
 Risk Identification:  This step identifies possible hazards by 
using brainstorming, techniq ues such as checklists, historical data 
analysis, and so forth and identifies those hazards based on the 
operational, financial, environmental and the safety threats 
(Osipova, 2007; McKinnon, 2024).  

   16 
 Risk Assessment:  Likelihood and impact of risks are analy zed 
via qualitative methodology  and quantitative methodology to 
prioritize them (Vincent, 2025).  
 Risk Mitigation:  Strategies like avoidance, reduction, transfer 
(e.g., via insurance), or acceptance are developed, tailored to the 
project’s context (Jones, 2024).  
 Risk Monitoring:  Continuous tracking of risks via the risk 
register ensures timely intervention and evaluat es mitigation 
effectiveness (Cochrane, 2024).  
 Risk Control:  Corrective actions are implemented to address 
emerging risks, refining strategies based on monitoring to keep 
the project aligned with objectives (Graham, 2023).  
2.4 Frameworks in Risk Management  
Risk management i n large-scale construction projects addresses 
uncertainties through structured theories and frameworks, crucial for 
managing complex, multi -stakeholder projects.  
ISO 31000  Framework  
The ISO 31000 provides the standardized approach of risk management 
which can be put to good use in the construction industry. Based on 
Abuyassin et al. (2018) and Sousa et al. (2012), it prioritizes early 
identification of risk, inclusion and consistency with decision making 
processes through inclusion of risk management. In construction, the 
use of ISO 31000 helps risk awareness due to which risk practices are 
matched with organizational objectives and thus delays and budget 
overrun are reduced (Alfreahat & Sebestyén, 2022; SMuthuveeran et 
al., 2019).  
Enterpris e Risk Management  Framework  
This approach is organization wide and addresses risk on an 
organizational level which includes financial, strategic, operational and 

   17 
compliance risk.  It improves both internal (e.g., resources related 
problems) and external (e. g., regulatory changes) risks and enhances 
resilience and supports the long -term growth in construction (Alfreahat 
& Sebestyén, 2022; Bachtiar & Prasetya, 2024; Mansour et al., 2023).  
Project Risk Management (PMBOK Guidelines)  
These project risk management  guidelines don’t just offer a framework 
but they are also quite detailed as far as how to manage the identified 
risk, this includes identification, analysis, response planning and 
monitoring. They are widely used in the construction business and they 
bring the continuous risk reassessment and stake holder behavior to 
ensure timely delivery, continuous delivery with no disturbances (Kara 
et al., 2023; Bachtiar & Prasetya, 2024; Bepari et al., 2022).  
2.5 Key Risk Categories in Construction Projects  
Large con struction projects suffer from many risks that can threaten the 
success of such projects, and will be classified in terms of financial, 
operational, environmental and regulatory/legal.  
 Financial Risks:  They are because of budgeting errors, inflation 
or unexpected expenses that are soaring, it will kill the project’s 
viability. Such examples include inaccurate budget estimate, 
increasing material price and unexpected site conditions (Hou, 
2024; Naik & Balapgol, 2019). There are such risks that lead to 
delays and lower profitability (Shibani et al., 2022).  
 Operational Risks : Daily challenges in execution add to the 
operational risks, and what results is a delay and inefficiency. 
Included are material shortages, equipment failure, workforce 
ineffeciencies th at lead to the reduction in productivity and 
timeline extension (Naik & SBalapgol, 2019; Khatleli, 2019).  
 Environmental Risks : The risks implicit in environmental are 
natural disaster, changes in climate, and ecologic issues in their 

   18 
ways affect the timeli ne and sustainability. Sites can be damaged 
by floods, extreme weather or regulatory compliance issues and 
progress is stymied (Naik & SBalapgol, 2019).  
 Regulatory and Legal Risks : Such risks include complying with 
building codes, settling contractual disp utes and adjusting to 
changes in policy that might result in legal disputes and project 
delay. Penalties and litigation can also occur due to non -
compliance, contractual conflicts and policy shift (Khatleli, 2019).  
2.6 Challenges in Risk Management Impleme ntation  
Implementing risk management in faces several challenges:  
 Stakeholder Misalignment:  Conflicting priorities among 
owners, contractors, and regulators hinder coordinated risk 
management, leading to inconsistent strategies (Gharaibeh, 
2019).  
 Difficult ies in Communicating and Making Decisions:  
Coordinated risk management not only requires coordination 
among owners, contractors, and regulators, conflicting priorities 
among owners, contractors, and regulators make it difficult to 
implement a coordinated strategy (Gharaibeh, 2019).  
 Resource Constraints:  It is important because, if there is 
ineffective communication and delayed decision making this may 
damage risk management and may also delay the project 
(Gharaibeh 2019; Construction Link 2025).  
2.7 Risk Mitigation Strategies in Construction  
Various strategies to mitigate risks:  
 Contingency Planning:  Allocating reserves and resources to 
handle unforeseen risks ensures adaptability without major 

   19 
disruptions, often through a risk budget (Malsam, 2024; 
LetsBu ild, 2023a).  
 Proactive Risk Management:  Identifying risks early and 
maintaining ongoing monitoring help reduce their effects, with 
success depending on strong collaboration among stakeholders 
(Lokeshwaran & Bharath, 2023; Malsam, 2024).  
 Technology Integrat ion: Technologies like BIM, AI, and IoT 
enhance risk prediction and monitoring. BIM aids in analyzing 
models, while AI automates tasks, keeping projects on track 
(Ishak et al., 2023; Aladayleh & Aladaileh, 2024; Manu, 2024).

3 METHODOLOGY  
In this chapter t he procedures used in carrying out this study are 
described.  The figure below shows an outline of the research procedure 
that describes the methodical approach that was taken in this study.  
These procedures are frequently used by researchers in various d omains 
to guarantee an organized inquiry.

3.1 Research Type  
The approach used in this research is qualitative in nature which is used 
to explore the factors that influence the success or failure of risk 
management in large scale construction projects. It is grounded in 
constructivism and interpretivism (Creswell, 2 007) and it looks at risks 
from the stakeholder perspective of project managers and contractors.

The contextual analysis, narrative inquiry and thematic exploration 
approaches (Braun & Clarke, 2006) are used to develop a detailed 
investigation of human, e nvironmental and organizational factors. This 
is consistent with the study’s aim of identifying risk types, assessing 
implementation challenges and assessing mitigation strategies, 
providing a more nuanced alternative to quantitative methods (Denzin 
& Linc oln, 2011).  
3.2 Data Collection Methods  
Data collection is done by reviewing the empirical study case studies and 
industry reports from peer -reviewed journals. Financial, operational, 
and mitigation focused risks are looked at from the peer reviewed 
articles such as Ramadhan and Waty (2025) on cost overruns and Hatefi 
et al. (2025) on fuzzy logic-based  risk assessment. Case studies, such 
as "the Probolinggo -Banyuwangi Toll Road Project" (Amin et al., 2025) 
and "the Jragung Dam Construction" (Adriantama et a l., 2025), offer 
practical, real -world insights. Industry reports of Vargas and Campos 
(2022) and Project Management Institute (2021) also offer up to date 
trends and better practices.  
For relevance, empirical rigor, and agreement with study aims, 38 
sourc es from 2017 to 2025 were chosen (see Table 1) . Recent works 
ensure contemporary relevance, while foundational studies like Ahmed 
(2017) offer historical context. Data preparation involved three steps: 
First, sources were selected based on criteria like pu blication in 
reputable journals and focus on large -scale projects. Second, textual 
data on risk categories, challenges, and strategies were extracted from 
abstracts, findings, and discussions. Third, data was organized into a 
coded dataset using a thematic  framework, with codes refined iteratively 
during analysis. An in -depth, fact -based investigation of construction 
risk management is supported by this multi -source methodology.

3.3 Data Analysis Techniques  
The process entailed a thorough literature review, coding of relevant 
excerpts, and theme generation (financial risks due to budget overruns, 
barriers to implementation, and risk management strategies) that were 
subsequently refined for a better understand ing of the implementation 
of risk management strategies in the major construction initiatives 
(Braun & Clarke, 2006). The themes were then iteratively refined based 
on the Braun and Clarke’s (2006) methodology in order to align with the 
objectives of the s tudy, for example obstacles to implementation of risk 
management.  
For handling large datasets, libraries such as “scikit-learn” (Pedregosa 
et al., 2011), “pandas ” (McKinney, 2010), “NLTK” (Loper & Bird, 2002) 

   23 
and “matplotlib/seaborn ” (Hunter, 2007; Waskom,  2021) could be easily 
used to spot trends in the data. Python’s scripted workflows ensured 
reproducibility (Wilson et al., 2014), while its flexibility integrated 
qualitative insights with quantitative techniques (Guest et al., 2012). As 
an open -source la nguage under permissive licenses, Python enabled 
accessible use (van Rossum & Drake, 2009).  
3.3.1 Python for Thematic Analysis: Meeting Research Objectives  
The study topics and objectives in Sections 1.2 and 1.3 were addressed 
using Python.  The following subsections detail techniques used to 
identify risk categories, analyze challenges, and evaluate mitigation 
strategies.  
Identification of Key Risk Categories  
Using 107 risk descriptions from 38 research (2017 –2025), Python 
expedited the proc ess of identifying the main risk categories:  
 Text Preprocessing : NLTK preprocessed text by lowercasing, 
tokenizing, removing stopwords (e.g., "and," "the," custom terms 
like "in," "of"), eliminating punctuation, and lemmatizing. For 
example, “Construction cost overruns threaten economic 
sustainability”  became ['construction', 'cost', 'overrun', 'threaten', 
'economic', 'sustainability'] .  
 Keyword -Based Categorization : A dictionary linked keywords 
to eight categories —Financial (e.g., "cost"), Operational (e.g ., 
"delay"), Safety (e.g., "accident"), Technical (e.g., "design"), 
Environmental (e.g., "geological"), Political (e.g., "instability"), 
Contractual (e.g., "dispute"), and Supply Chain (e.g., "delivery"). 
Risks were assigned to categories by keyword matchi ng, with 
unmatched risks labeled "Other Risks." For example, "Inflation 
rate volatility was identified as a critical risk" was classified as 
Political Risks due to "volatility."  

   24 
 Analysis and Visualization : Risks were analyzed for 
distribution, visualized via a bar chart, and word clouds per 
category using Matplotlib and WordCloud, with a summary of 
distributions.  
Insights into Common Challenges  
Python analyzed 76 challenge descriptions from 38 studies (2017 –2025) 
to explore risk management challenges (e.g. , stakeholder misalignment, 
poor communication):  
 Frequency Analysis:  NLTK preprocessed text to lowercase, 
tokenize, stopwords  (e.g., "the," custom terms like "risk"), and 
lemmatizing (e.g., "hinders" to "hinder"). Pandas computed term 
frequencies, and Matp lotlib plotted the top 10 terms (e.g., 
"hinder" (25), "complicate" (23)) in a bar chart, uncovering 
barriers like resource constraints ("lack") and complexity.  
 Network Analysis:  NetworkX created a graph with challenges as 
nodes, linking those with shared terms (e.g., "complexity").  
Degree centrality identified systemic challenges, like "Poor 
understanding of new risks hinders safety management" 
(centrality: 0. 987). A graph visual ized the top 5 central 
challenges, showing interconnections.  
 Word Cloud Visualization:  WordCloud displayed frequent terms 
(e.g., "hinder," "complicate"), emphasizing prevalent themes.  
Effective Mitigation Strategies  
Python evaluated 82 mitigation strategie s from 38 sources (2017 –2025) 
to identify effective approaches (e.g., contingency planning, technology 
adoption):  
 Text Preprocessing and Topic Modeling:  NLTK preprocessed 
text—lowercase conversion, tokenizing, removing stopwords 
(e.g., "the," custom terms like "mitigate"), and lemmatizing. 

   25 
Scikit -learn’s LDA identified 5 topics using a TF -IDF matrix (300 
features).  
 Keyword Extraction:  RAKE extracted phrases like "building 
information modeling," cross -referenced with examples like 
Adriantama et al. (2025), where technology mitigated operational 
risks.  
 Frequency Analysis:  Pandas identified frequent terms (e.g., 
"planning," "bim"), aligning with the question’s examples of 
contingency planning and technology adoption.  
 Visualization:  A bar chart displayed the to p 10 terms; word 
clouds per topic emphasized key terms (e.g., "cost" in 
Contingency Planning).

4.2 Empirical Studies  
A chronological analysis of empirical studies emerges from the literature 
search starting from 2025 up to 2017.   
Ramadhan and Waty’s (2025) study surveyed 120 profe ssionals on the 
risk faced to the cost overrun on major Indonesian construction projects 
and used project data to examine the problems. The methods and 
simulations were used to identify design and planning errors as the main 
causers of cost overrun and sho wed that Building Information Modeling 
(BIM) and structured change protocols reduced those risks largely, 
proving a practical and data driven strategy to improve cost 
management in such projects.  
Hatefi et al. (2025) used mixed methodology to acquire data and use 
sophisticated analytics to assess associated risks in mass housing 

   28 
projects. The study used fuzzy ranked as risks such as import/export 
limitations, changes in the inflation rate. Results of these empirical data 
showed that they were substantive fa ctors affecting the costs and 
deadlines, and fuzzy logic afforded a quantifiable framework improving 
allocation efficiency of resources to high volume building situations.  
In an extensive review and analysis of the existing literature for 
considering the s upply chain challenges faced by small and medium 
sized enterprises (SME) in construction projects, Chen et al, (2025) 
observed that there are multiple risks in the domain of management, 
operations and sustainability, including delays in materials, budget 
constraint. It provided a tool for assessing the level of risk and to 
highlight the gaps for next research, which improve SME project's 
resilience level.  
Amin et al. (2025) used surveys, document analysis, and interviews to 
look into the dangers associated with Indonesia's Probolinggo -
Banyuwangi Toll Road Project Package 2.  The assessment of risks 
targeting delayed delivery together with rising material prices relied on 
probability and impact assessment to develop mitigation strategies 
which stakeholders val idated through feedback monitoring systems.  
Results demonstrate that the focus mitigation is vital in the sustainable 
way of managing complex infrastructure projects.  
Ahmad et al. (2025) presented a bridge project sustainability risk 
assessment framework w hich united risk analysis and BIM together with 
Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA). The Pareto Principle helped 
identify 38 out of 55 risks that were responsible for 80% of lifecycle 
impact through survey results. The framework achieved effective 
implementation during real -world application on a bridge project which 
demonstrated that supervision and construction phases will be key to 
sustainable development compliance with ISO guidelines.  
In Senić et al. (2025), the Delphi method was used as a tool  for soliciting 
37 multidisciplinary experts’ feedback to classify the 56 risks and 302 

   29 
preventive measures for mitigating risk in road infrastructure projects. 
An MCDM approach was used to evaluate measures in terms of 
implementation cost, time, complexit y and success probability and this 
was validated using fuzzy logic.  The framework prioritized preventive 
strategies, providing actionable guidance for resource allocation and 
enhancing risk management effectiveness.  
In the Jragung Dam Construction Project Package 2, Adriantama et al. 
(2025) implemented a combination of lack construction and risk 
management with brainstorming, Borda and FMEA.  The study identified 
key waste types, such as defects (20.05%), and critical risks like 
incomplete diversion channel s (RPN = 108). Empirical results confirmed 
the effectiveness of a genetic -algorithm -based K -means clustering 
method, providing a structured approach to minimize waste and 
enhance project efficiency.  
Ullah et al. (2024) examined factors analysis for risk id entification 
methods in international contracting projects using survey method. 
Politicial risks such as expropriation and policy changes were strongly 
highlighted in the data collected from construction experts. Systematic 
risk management was shown to hel p in delaying problems and how 
contractors operating in politically unstable locations can benefit from a 
practical approach of this.  
Tang et al. (2024)  used text mining to find safety risk factors in the 
construction of the metro, building toward safety r isk factors from the 
safety risk information of the Metro Project Safety Risk Early Warning 
System. Both high frequency danger phrases were retrieved using Jieba 
word segmentation and TF -IDF analysis and complications such as 
nearby structures were exposed . This resulted in data driven approach 
to improve on -site safety management against the issues that stand 
with the traditional methods.  
The comprehensive literature review and bibliometric analysis was done 
by Shishehgarkhaneh et al. (2024) based on the articles of Construction 

   30 
supply chain risk management (CSCRM) from 1999 to 2023. The study 
started from 2016 when the research changing fr om surveys to the AI 
techniques using Gephi and VOSviewer. The expanded CSCRM stages 
introduced by Insights included risk allocation and recovery which 
provided complete understanding of emerging patterns.   
Jackson and Priya (2024) employed structural equa tion modeling and 
questionnaire survey of 462 Ghanaian professionals to find out such poor 
resource planning that is important in terms of risk variables. The model 
determines that outcome determinants are resource planning, conflict 
resolution and technol ogical expertise and recommends obligatory 
conflict resolution boards in order to improve project performance.  
Gao et al. (2024) based on natural language processing (NLP), design a 
Multi-sentence Context aware Risk Identification (MCRI) model for risk 
event extraction from news article. The model was tested on a 
supervised dataset and it delivers with an F1 -score of 87.1% 
outperforming the baselines. Threshold approach automated the risk 
identification enabling infrastructure projects to undertake early -stage 
risk assessment from today.  
In Al-Mhdawi et al. (2024), a FMEA model based on fuzzy was applied 
to the oil and gas construction risk assessment in many ways like the 
questionnaire and interview with the project managers in the United 
States. The study lists 41 factors causing risk and non -compliance with 
PPE regulations was ranked as the most vital factor. Mitigation solutions 
using open ended questionnaires were used to validate in order to 
improve risk understanding for project success.  
The study by Z hao (2023) examined 2034 publications about 
construction risk management (CRM) through document co -citation and 
bibliographic coupling analysis of the publications from 2000 to 2021. 
Themes such as advanced risk analysis as well as ICT driven CRM were 
identified and their trends of adoption that were identified by the 

   31 
analysis.  The research brought together theoretical and practical CRM 
development to provide practitioners complete knowledge.  
Yousri et al. (2023) assessed risks in Egyptian building construc tion 
through a pilot survey with 15 experts and a broader survey of 95 
participants, using a Likert scale. Funding issues and material price 
variations surfaced as major risk considerations.  The findings redefined 
risks based on economic shifts, providing a model to control critical risks 
and enhance project performance.  
The ZW high -speed railway in China served as the basis for Xiang et al. 
(2023) to verify their integrated risk assessment method targeting 
cross-regional mega construction projects (CMCPs).  Drawn from AHP 
and cross -impact analysis data identified 12 threat and vulnerability 
factors with local government conflicts being one of them. The results 
emphasized coordination mechanisms, offering transferable strategies 
for CMCPs.  
System dynamics com bined with the AHP -EWM method was used to 
analyze tunnel security risk management efficiency in Chinese 
megaprojects by Liu et al. (2023).  Simulations with Vensim software 
pinpointed real -time risk adaptation as a key factor. The approach 
demonstrated that  comprehensive risk awareness networks improve 
efficiency, guiding tunnel security management.  
Khodeir (2023) reviewed 43 Scopus -indexed papers from 2000 to 2021 
to identify risks in fast -track construction projects. The synthesis 
highlighted risks, such a s unfair risk distribution due to contract terms, 
recommending scope assessment. This study clarified risk 
management’s role in accelerating delivery under high complexity.  
Developed by Coskun et al. (2023), RAMSCOM risk assessment method 
for megaprojects is tested on a real case by using AHP and cross impact 
analysis. Social, environmental, and economic critical hazards were 
identified and decisions regarding mitigation decisions were supported 

   32 
by visualization. Adding sustainability made this strategy wor k towards 
megaprojects long term success.  
Canesi and Gallo (2023) applied the ANAC risk assessment tool to the 
SSv-51 road variant project, forecasting a 7.53% cost increase. 
Validation showed a 1.34% deviation from actual costs, demonstrating 
the tool’s a ccuracy in mitigating cost overruns and supporting 
sustainable infrastructure planning.  
Shibani et al. (2022) surveyed Lebanese construction experts to identify 
financial risks, such as currency fluctuation, amid an economic crisis. 
The study validated the  advantage of risk management by reducing 
overruns, but few are implementing it, and it offers limited advice in 
areas traumatized by crises.  
Osei-Kyei et al. (2022) performed a scientometric review on 1,635 
publications indexed on Scopus from 1979 to 2022  through their 
analysis with VOSviewer and Gephi.  Emerging themes that indicate 
heightened attention as the sector transitions to sector 5.0 include risk -
integrated planning. Future research is guided by the findings of this 
study.  
Nguyen et al. (2022) employed factor analysis to identify seven risk 
factors, including financial risks, in the selection of joint venture 
contractors after surveying 100 Vietnamese professionals. The findings 
linked effective risk ranking to project succe ss, aiding decision -making 
in complex infrastructure projects.  
Khairullah et al. (2022) identified risks in EPC projects through 
questionnaires with construction professionals. Design and contract risks 
were shown to be crucial, and the findings linked del ays to a lack of risk 
management, which helped to guide risk reduction strategies.  
Santarsiero et al. (2021) used data from Google Street View and 
OpenStreetMap to test the Italian Guidelines on Bridge Risk 
Management. When applied to a Basilicata bridge s tock, conservative 

   33 
risk classifications were found, and approaches for prioritizing 
evaluations for in -depth analyses were suggested.  
Li et al. (2021) used fuzzy set theory and interviews to identify 75 risk 
factors in mega infrastructure projects (MIPs). Validation provided a 
framework for MIP risk management that was expanded for 
sustainability, and coordination and economic risks were crucial.  
An analytical network process (ANP) model was developed by Erol et al. 
(2021) to measure risks in megaprojects. A two -round Delphi study was 
used to validate the model across 11 projects.  The findings ranked risk 
sources, improving the accuracy of risk assessments for practitioners.  
Banerjee Chattapadhyay  et al. (2021) surveyed experts on 63 risk 
factors in megaproj ects, applying GA –K-means clustering and SMOTE. 
The approach offered a predictive paradigm to enhance megaproject 
performance by identifying time and cost issues as crucial.  
Zhang et al. (2020) identified environmental and technological risks as 
safety -critical after conducting expert interviews and surveying 399 
Chinese subway professionals. The number of accidents in subway 
projects was reduced as a result of better safety management.  
Shaktawat and Vadhera (2020) reviewed the risks related to 
hydropower p rojects and proposed synthesis -based sensitivity analysis. 
Cost-estimating methods for sustainable development in developing 
countries were presented by emphasizing the risks related to the 
building phase.  
Aarthipriya et al. (2020) used Primavera software to perform sensitivity 
analysis and Monte Carlo simulation to examine the hazards associated 
with residential development in Bangalore. The results quantified time 
and cost impacts, improving decision -making through effective risk 
management.  

   34 
Sharma and Gu pta (2019) reviewed the literature to determine 67 risk 
variables and ranked them using questionnaire surveys.  Early risk 
assessment in construction projects was aided by the validation of top 
risks, such as funding unavailability.  
After surveying 22 Pakistani contractor companies on 100 projects, 
Nawaz et al. (2019) discovered a connection between risk management 
and project performance.  The importance of organized risk strategies in 
developing nations was highlighted by insights.  
Through a review of the literature, Bahamid et al. (2019) found 111 risk 
variables in building projects in developing nations, of which 56 were 
deemed essential. The plan provided the framework for achieving 
schedule, cost, and quality goals.  
In an online poll of construction  experts, Saeed (2018) found that time 
and expense overruns were the most common hazards. Suggestions like 
better planning lessened the effects of subpar company performance.

5 RESULT S 
The research findings and their implications are presented in this section 
in relation to the goals and inquiries of the study. Objectives  are: (1) to 
identify key risk categories in large -scale construction projects, (2) to 
analyze challenges in risk management implementation,  (3) to evaluate 
effective mitigation strategies from the literature. The research 
questions were: RQ1: What are the primary risk  categories, such as 
financial, operational, and environmental risks, in large -scale projects? 
RQ2: What challenges, like stakeholder misalignment, hinder risk 
management? RQ3: What are the most effective mitigation strategies, 
such as contingency planning , in the literature? The conclusions are 
based on three datasets: risk_categories.csv (107 dangers), 
common_challenges.csv (76 problems), and mitigation_strategies.csv 
(82 strategies) obtained from 38 studies between 2017 and 2025.  The 
results answer all t opics, followed by comments that integrate the data 
to convey overall knowledge of risk management dynamics.  Table 4 
(Appendix 1) summarizes the 38 sources, aligning their contributions 
with results in Sections 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3.  
5.1 Identification of Key Risk Categories  
The analysis of the “risk_categories.csv” dataset, with 107 risk 
descriptions from 38 studies (2017 –2025), addressed the question  RQ1. 
A Python -implemented keyword -based approach categorized risks into 
eight predefined groups —Financial, Ope rational, Safety, Technical, 
Environmental, Political, Contractual, and Supply Chain Risks —with 
unmatched risks labeled "Other Risks." Analysis and Visualization , 
including a bar chart,  and word clouds, offered a detailed risk distribution 
overview.  
The data revealed a variety of risk categories, with "Other Risks" 
appearing the most frequently at 31 times (29.0%).  This category 

   36 
included emerging risks like "Lack of knowledge of new technology slows 
project efficiency" (Jackson & Priya, 2024) and "Unident ified risks from 
past projects threaten early -stage planning" (Gao et al., 2024). 
Operational risks were followed by 19 occurrences (17.8%), commonly 
associated with "delay" and "schedule," as in "Delays of 40% in project 
timelines were driven by design mo difications" (Ramadhan & Waty, 
2025).  Technical Risks had 11 instances (10.3%), while Financial Risks 
had 10 (9.3%). Technical Risks involved design and equipment failures, 
such as "Design revision led to defects and financial losses" (Adriantama 
et al., 2 025), while Financial Risks were linked to cost overruns, as in "  
Construction cost overruns threaten economic sustainability " (Li et al., 
2021). 
Supply Chain and Environmental Risks each had eight incidences 
(7.5%).  Supply Chain Risks included "Delays in material delivery disrupt 
timelines for SMEs" (Chen et al., 2025), while Environmental Risks 
involved geological issues, like "Geological challenges increased costs" 
(Adriantama et al., 2025). Political and Safety Risks each had 7 
instances (6.5%), with Po litical Risks tied to instability (e.g., "Political 
unpredictability delays projects" by Ullah et al., 2024) and Safety Risks 
to concerns like "High accident rates threaten worker safety" (Zhang et 
al., 2020). Contractual Risks were least frequent, with 6 instances 
(5.6%), as in "Contract -related risks increase costs in EPC projects" 
(Khairullah et al., 2022).  
Figure 2 depicts the “distribution of risk categories ”, with "Other Risks" 
(31 occasions) and Operational Risks (19 times) taking the lead  and 
word clouds are in Appendix 2.  

   37 
 
Figure 2.  Distribution of risk categories across 107 risk descriptions  
The high incidence of "Other Risks" (29.0%) implies that many hazards 
are context -specific or do not fit into specified categories, such as 
technology hurdles (Jackson & Priya, 2024) or historical risk carryovers 
(Gao et al., 2024). This aligns with Nawaz et al. (2019), who noted 
unmanaged risks threaten project success in Pakistan.  
Construction businesses employ a variety of ways to address these 
"other" hazards. First, they keep dynamic risk registers and hold 
workshops to identify hazards such as "lack o f skilled labor" (Amin et 
al., 2025). Second, firms consult experts to assess technological risks, 
such as BIM, as demonstrated by Ramadhan and Waty (2025). Third, 
scenario planning anticipates risks like "Uncertainties in Industry 5.0" 
(Osei-Kyei et al., 2022). Fourth, real -time monitoring adapts to evolving 
risks, as in Amin et al. (2025). Fifth, firms learn from historical data, 
using lessons from "Scattered historical risk events" (Gao et al., 2024). 
Finally, flexible frameworks with AI -driven analytics  (Shishehgarkhaneh 
et al., 2024) identify risks like "Complexity of megaprojects" (Erol et al., 


   38 
2021). Because of the presence of "other" risks, classifications should 
be refined to encompass technical and sustainability issues, with 
sophisticated methods used for uncategorized hazards.  
Operational Risks (17.8%) as the second most frequent category 
highlight delays, echoing Ramadhan and Waty (2025) and Saeed 
(2018). The share of Technical (10.3%) and Financial Risks (9.3%) 
reflects the challenge of managing  cost overruns and design issues, as 
design changes often cause both (Adriantama et al., 2025; Ramadhan 
& Waty, 2025). Environmental Risks (7.5%) emphasize sustainability 
and geological concerns, especially in megaprojects (Ahmad et al., 
2025). According t o Ullah et al. (2024) and Zhang et al. (2020), “political  
risks”  and “safety risks ” (6.5% each) reflect external and human 
variables that disrupt deadlines and safety . The lower frequency of 
Contractual Risks (5.6%) suggests they are less pervasive, though 
significant in contexts like EPC projects (Khairullah et al., 2022). These 
findings indicate that risk management must prioritize operational 
delays and developing haz ards while resolving financial and 
technological issues.  
5.2 Insights into Common Challenges  
The analysis of the “common_challenges.csv” dataset, with 76 challenge 
descriptions from 38 studies (2017 –2025), addressed the question  RQ2. 
Python -based text anal ysis, using NLTK and NetworkX for frequency and 
network analysis, identified patterns in challenges. Visualizations like a 
bar chart, network graph, and word cloud offered insights into their 
thematic distribution and interconnections.  
Frequency analysis s howed "hinder" as the most frequent term (25 
instances), followed by "complicate" (23 instances). Other terms 
included "risk" (10 instances), "complexity" (8 instances), "limit" and 
"effective" (7 instances each), "poor," "lack," and "delay" (6 instances 
each), and "plan" (5 instances). These words emphasize resource 

   39 
restrictions and complexity as major hurdles. For example, "Poor 
understanding of new risks hinders safety management" (Zhang et al., 
2020) and "Complexity of 63 risk factors hinders analysis" (Banerjee 
Chattapadhyay et al., 2021) show how understanding and analytical 
complexity impede risk management. Figure 3 illustrates the top 10 
frequent terms, confirming the prevalence of "hinder" and "complicate."  
 
Figure 3. Top 10 frequent terms in challenges across 76 challenge 
descriptions.  
The directed graph created using NetworkX was first implemented with 
challenges as nodes and having shared lemmatized terms as edges . 
Degree centrality identified "Poor understanding o f new risks hinders  
safety management" (Zhang et al., 2020) as the most interconnected 
(centrality: 0.987), followed by "Complexity of 63 risk factors hinders 
analysis" (Banerjee Chattapadhyay et al., 2021; centrality: 0.907) and 
"Legal risks in joint vent ures hinder contract enforcement" (centrality: 
0.880). Two others, "Poor logistics coordination complicated timely 
material delivery" (centrality: 0.853) and "Limited data on low -risk 


   40 
factors like unpredictable fire hinders assessment" (centrality: 0.853),  
were also highly connected. These top 5 issues are visualized in Figure 
4, which provides linkages through phrases like "complicate" and 
"hinder." For example, "complicate" links supply chain recovery 
(Challenge 5) and coordination difficulties (Challenge  9), while "hinder" 
links safety management (Challenge 57) and contract enforcement 
(Challenge 46) . A word cloud emphasizing "hinder" and "complexity" is 
in Appendix 3.  
 
Figure 4. Network of top 5 central challenges based on shared terms.  
The prevalence of "hinder" (25 instances) and "complicate" (23 
instances) underscores barriers to risk management, especially in 
understanding risks. The high centrality of "Poor understanding of new 
risks hinders safety management" (0.987) indicates that a lack of 
awareness has an influence on safety, which is consistent with Zhang et 
al. (2020). Similarly, "Complexity of 63 risk factors hinders analys is" 
(centrality: 0.907) implies analytical difficulties (Banerjee 


   41 
Chattapadhyay et al., 2021).  The network graph shows interconnected 
challenges, affecting coordination (Challenge 9) and assessment of low -
risk factors (Challenge 5). The terms "poor" and "l ack" (6 times each) 
denote resource limits, as in "Poor coordination increases complexity" 
(Li et al., 2021).  "Delay" (6 instances) highlights inefficiencies, per Liu 
et al. (2023). These findings confirm stakeholder misalignment and poor 
communication as critical challenges, often seen as "poor" coordination 
and "complicated" collaboration in joint ventures (Challenges 9 and 46). 
Effective risk management involves overcoming systemic hurdles, 
particularly recognizing new hazards, managing complexity, and 
enhancing coordination.  
5.3 Evaluation of Effective Mitigation Strategies  
The analysis of the “mitigation_strategies.csv” dataset, with 82 
mitigation strategy descriptions from 38 studies (2017 –2025), 
addressed the question  RQ3. Python -based text analysis, using LDA 
topic modeling, frequency analysis, and keyword extraction with NLTK, 
Scikit -learn, and RAKE, identified prevalent strategies. Visualizations 
such as bar charts and word clouds per subject offered information about 
their thematic distribution.  
Four themes were found using LDA topic modeling and categorized 
accordingly. Topic 1, "Contingency Planning," used terminology like 
"cost," "analysis," "overrun," "factor," and "sensitivity," focused on 
financial risk methods (e.g., "Sensitivity analysis mit igates cost overrun 
risks" by Aarthipriya et al., 2020).  Topic 2, "Risk Identification," featured 
"control," "factor," "implement," "identify," and "management," focusing 
on identifying risks (e.g., "Improved contract management mitigates 
business risks" b y Saeed, 2018). Topic 3, "Other Mitigation Strategy," 
included "management," "aid," "project," "effective," and "factor," 
suggesting general strategies (e.g., "Identifying critical risk factors aids 
project management" by Jackson & Priya, 2024). Among the words used 

   42 
in Topic 4, "Systematic Frameworks," were "political," "management," 
"delay," "assessment," and "decision," suggesting organized methods 
(e.g., "ANP model quantifies risks for prioritization" by Erol et al., 2021).  
Frequency analysis showed "man agement" as the most frequent term 
(17 instances), followed by "factor" (11 instances), "assessment," 
"identify," and "project" (8 instances each), and "accuracy," "reduces," 
"cost," "aid," and "strategy" (6 instances each). These words place a 
strong emph asis on risk detection and systematic management.  For 
example, "Implementing Building Information Modeling (BIM) enhances 
planning accuracy" (Ramadhan &  Waty, 2025) highlights technology’s 
role, while "Risk -integrated planning enhances project scheduling" 
(Osei-Kyei et al., 2022) focuses on project management. Figure 5 
illustrates the top 10 frequent terms, confirming "management" and 
"factor" prominence.  Appendix 4 has word clouds for each topic, 
including terminology such as "cost" in contingency planning.  
 
Figure 5. Top 10 frequent terms in mitigation strategies across 82 
descriptions.  


   43 
The prominence of "management" (18 instanc es) and "project" (9 
instances) aligns with the focus on structured strategies, as effective 
mitigation requires robust project management (Jackson & Priya, 2024; 
Osei-Kyei et al., 2022). Risk identification procedures (Topic 4) are 
supported by "Factor" ( 11 times) and "identify" (9 instances), as in 
"Sensitivity analysis identifies key risk factors" (Aarthipriya et al., 2020). 
"Cost" (6 instances) in Topic 1 highlights contingency planning’s role in 
financial risks, per Aarthipriya et al. (2020) and Ramadh an and Waty 
(2025). "Systematic Frameworks" (Topic 2) with "model" underscores 
structured approaches (Erol et al., 2021). Although "technology 
adoption" wasn’t a labeled topic, "accuracy" (6 instances) and BIM 
references (Ramadhan & Waty, 2025) suggest its  relevance. The title 
"Other Mitigation Strategy" in Topic 3 suggests that some strategies —
like separating project management from operational strategies —need 
more precise classification.  
These findings suggest that effective mitigation in large -scale proj ects 
requires contingency planning, rigorous frameworks, and risk 
identification. Contingency planning addresses financial risks, 
systematic frameworks control risks, and risk identification ensures 
targeted mitigation, addressing risks from Section 5.1. T echnology 
adoption, inferred through "accuracy," supports its growing role 
(Ramadhan & Waty, 2025).  
  

   44 
6 DISCUSSION  
This discussion synthesizes findings from Sections 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3, 
analyzing the “risk_categories.csv,” “common_challenges.csv,” and 
“mitiga tion_strategies.csv” datasets . Thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke, 
2006) was the qualitative approach which based on constructivism and 
interpretivism (Creswell, 2007) and investigated risk management on 
large construction project.  The findings relate to the objectives: (1) 
identify key risk categories, (2) analyze risk management challenges, 
and (3) evaluate effective mitigation strategies, corresponding to the 
research questions in the introduction.  
6.1 Primary Risk Categories: Im plications and Insights  
Section 5.1 revealed several risk categories, with "Other Risks" (29.0%) 
and Operational Risks (17.8%) being the most common, followed by 
Technical Risks (10.3%) and Financial Risks (9.3%).  The keyword -based 
approach mapped risks, b ut the high "Other Risks" (e.g., "Lack of 
knowledge of new technology slows project efficiency" by Jackson & 
Priya, 2024) suggests keyword dictionary limitations, as noted in the 
methodology. This aligns with Nawaz et al. (2019), who emphasized 
controlling  growing risks in regions such as Pakistan.  
Delays cause operational risks (Ramadhan & Waty, 2025), which are 
indicative of a systemic issue (Saeed, 2018).  Technical and financial 
risks are linked, as design changes result in cost overruns and technical 
failures (Adriantama et al., 2025). Environmental Risks (7.5%), like 
geological challenges (Adriantama et al., 2025), emphasize 
sustainability in megaprojects (Ahmad et al., 2025). Risk management 
must prioritize operational efficiency, sustainability, and integrated 
financial -technical strategies.  

   45 
6.2 Common Challenges: Barriers to Effective Risk Management  
Section 5.2 highlighted systemic hurdles, with the phrases "hinder" (25 
occasions) and "complicate" (23 instances) appearing often in the 
frequency anal ysis. Network study of 76 issues using NetworkX revealed 
interconnection, with "Poor understanding of new risks hinders safety 
management" (centrality: 0.987; Zhang et al., 2020) being the most 
central. This aligns with the methodology’s thematic focus (Br aun & 
Clarke, 2006), showing how unawareness of emerging risks affects 
safety (Zhang et al., 2020).  
Terms like "poor" and "lack" (6 instances each) indicate resource 
constraints, as in "Poor coordination increases complexity" (Li et al., 
2021), confirming stakeholder misalignment and poor communication. 
Figure 4 depicts a network graph that connects difficulties related to 
safety, coordination, and the assessment of low -risk elements.  Effective 
risk management requires addressing coordination and risk aware ness 
barriers.  
6.3 Risk Mitigation Strategies: Effectiveness and Applicability  
Section 5.3 identified mitigation strategies via topic modeling and 
frequency analysis. Contingency Planning (Topic 1), Risk Identification 
(Topic 2), and Systematic Frameworks (Topic 4) appeared, with 
"management" (17 instances) and "factor" (11 instances) being the 
most common.  Contingency planning, focusing on "cost" (e.g., 
"Sensitivity analysis mitigates cost overrun risks" by Aarthipriya et al., 
2020), addresses Financial Ri sks (Ramadhan & Waty, 2025). Risk 
identification, focusing on "management" and "identify" (e.g., 
"Improved contract management mitigates business risks" by Saeed, 
2018), targets Contractual and Operational Risks. Systematic 
frameworks that include "decisio n" (e.g., "ANP model quantifies risks" 
by Erol et al., 2021) address complexity issues (Banerjee Chattapadhyay 
et al., 2021).  

   46 
The LDA approach proved effective, although Topic 3's label "Other 
Mitigation Strategy" indicates that finer themes are required.  
Technology adoption, as shown by "accuracy" (6 occurrences) and BIM 
(Ramadhan & Waty, 2025), reinforces its significance in creative 
projects (Adriantama et al., 2025).  
6.4 Interconnections Between Risks, Challenges, and Mitigation 
Strategies  
The findings  show interconnections, reflecting the methodology’s multi -
source approach. Operational Risks like delays (Ramadhan & Waty, 
2025) are worsened by challenges such as poor coordination (Li et al., 
2021). Risk identification and systematic frameworks mitigate  these by 
identifying key factors (Aarthipriya et al., 2020) and providing 
structured control (Erol et al., 2021). Financial Risks link to complexity 
challenges (Banerjee Chattapadhyay et al., 2021), which contingency 
planning addresses through cost manage ment (Aarthipriya et al., 2020).  
While technology adoption (i.e., BIM), reduces Operational and 
Technical Risks through improved planning as well as reducing design 
errors (Ramadhan & Waty, 2025), challenges of 'Poor understanding of 
new risks' (Zhang et al., 2020) can pose barriers to adoption. They 
minimize environmental risks through systematic frameworks that 
involve sustainability (Ahmad et al., 2025).  
6.5 Broader Implications for Risk Management  
Effective risk management in large scale construction p rojects suggests 
that a holistic approach is needed from 38 sources.  The operational and 
financial risks, and other issues like lack of coordination, emphasize the 
need for efficient and financial solution like contingency planning, 
identification of risk and methodical framework.  Given, technology 
adoption, here, BIM, resolves operational, technical and environmental 

   47 
risks and therefore promotes sustainability.  The constructed viewpoint 
emphasizes that the stakeholders need to be more involved in 
coordinat ing and increasing awareness of risks in order for practitioners 
to achieve mitigation methods proper implementation.  
  

   48 
7 CONCLUSION  
This chapter summarizes the interpretation of the key findings from the 
study on risk management in large scale construction projects relative 
to the research goal and question as presented in Chapter 1. This section 
also discusses the practical and theoretical implications of these findings 
as well as making recommendations to future research filling out the 
gaps stated towards  Chapter 5 and staying with the construction risk 
management enterprise.  
7.1 Summary of Key Findings  
The study achieved its three objectives and were addressed through the 
analysis of three datasets —risk_categories.csv (107 risk descriptions), 
common_challenges.csv (76 challenge descriptions), and 
mitigation_strategies.csv (82 mitigation strategy descriptions) —
compiled from 38 empirical sources spanning 2017 –2025.  
Identification of Key Risk Categories:  According to the report, 
"Other Risks" (29. 0%) and Operational Risks (17.8%) dominate the risk 
landscape, followed by Technical Risks (10.3%) and Financial Risks 
(9.3%).  "Other Risks" included emerging or context -specific risks, such 
as technological adoption challenges (Jackson & Priya, 2024), whi le 
Operational Risks were driven by delays (Ramadhan & Waty, 2025). 
Environmental risks (7.5%) emphasized the necessity of sustainability 
(Ahmad et al., 2025), while the interconnection of Technical and 
Financial Risks underlined the need for integrated ri sk management 
systems (Adriantama et al., 2025).  
Insights into Common Challenges:  Systemic barriers to risk 
management were identified, with "hinder" (25 instances) and 
"complicate" (23 instances) as the most frequent terms. It was found 
that "Poor underst anding of new risks hinders safety management" 
(Zhang et al., 2020) has substantial information one about the roles of 

   49 
the poor understanding of developing risks on measures of safety and 
operational performance.  Challenges like poor coordination and 
compl exity (Li et al., 2021) confirmed the research question’s focus on 
stakeholder misalignment and poor communication, emphasizing the 
need for improved coordination and risk awareness.  
Evaluation of Effective Mitigation Strategies:   
The analysis confirmed th at both contingency planning and risk 
identification and methodical frameworks function as essential strategic 
plans especially when considering the most frequent use of 
"management" and "factor" . Aarthipriya et al. (2020) addresses financial 
risks plannin g, Saeed (2018) addresses risk identification for delays, and 
Erol et al. (2021) addresses the using systematic frameworks to tackle 
complexity. Terms including technology adoption like “accuracy” 
(Ramadhan & Waty, 2025) inferred technology adoption, and i t is 
consistent with the research question’s focus on its adoption.  
Integrated Discussion:  During the discussion panel various risks and 
challenges and their corresponding mitigation methods were linked with 
one another.  Poor coordination made operational risks (such delays) 
worse, while complexity was associated with financial risks. These risks 
were both reduced by systematic frameworks, risk identification, and 
contingency planning.  Technology adoption, particularly BI M, addressed 
Operational, Technical, and Environmental Risks, though 
implementation challenges, such as limited understanding, persisted.  
The lessons learnt in these insights’ stresses on the importance of a 
holistic risk management that balances out opera tional efficiency, cost 
control and sustainability while running with risks and challenges.  

   50 
7.2 Addressing Research Goals  
The research questions were successfully answered and the contribution 
of the study was everything one could think about dynamic risk 
management in large construction projects : 
Research Question 1:  “Which risk categories are most important for 
major building projects? ” The study identified Operational and Financial 
Risks as dominant, with Environmental Risks highlighting sustainability 
concerns. An important frequency (29.0%) showed that the “Other 
Risks” were developing risks and more fully understood risk profile in 
building projects.  
Research Question 2:  “What obstacles exist for efficient risk 
management? ” The findings confirmed stake holder misalignment and 
poor communication as critical challenges, manifesting as poor 
coordination and complexity, with a lack of risk awareness exacerbating 
safety and operational issues.  
Research Question 3:  “Which risk reduction techniques, according t o 
the literature, are the most successful?”  Contingency planning, risk 
identification, methodical frameworks, and technology adoption (e.g., 
BIM) were highlighted as useful solutions for mitigating financial, 
operational, and technical risks and encouragin g sustainability.  
7.3 Implications for Risk Management  
These findings create essential implications which affect both theory and 
practical application of construction risk management.  The study 
demonstrates theoretically that adaptable risk classification systems 
must exist to detect new risks because 29.0% of the respondents 
identified "Other Risks".  Research should focus on constructing 
integrated models which address risks and challenges as complete 
systems since risk management faces these characteristi cs in practice.  
In real terms, the focus on backup planning spotting risks, and organized 

   51 
methods gives useful ways to handle money and work risks. At the same 
time, BIM's part in making planning more exact and eco -friendlier  opens 
a door to update buildin g methods (Ramadhan & Waty 2025; Ahmad et 
al. 2025).  To overcome implementation barriers, practitioners must top 
their list of things to do as improving stakeholder coordination and 
awareness of risks, and also applying mitigation strategies to real 
projec ts. 
7.4 Final Remarks  
The vital aspects of large-scale construction risk management were 
identified, the systemic challenges were revealed and effective 
mitigation strategy was evaluated in this study.  A key finding is that 
there are operational and financ ial risks, widespread issues of poor 
coordination and complexity, and the effectiveness of interventions, i.e. 
contingency planning, risk identification, structured approaches, and 
technological adoption, namely building information modeling.  The 
research provides useful risk management practice improvement 
insights even though it faces constraints from literature -based data 
analysis and the absence of stakeholder input and its wide geographical 
range.  
By addressing stakeholder misalignment, enhancing risk awareness, and 
leveraging technology for sustainable outcomes, practitioners can 
enhance the resilience of large -scale construction projects. Future 
research, as outlined in Section 7.6, should focus on incorporating real -
time data, region -specific analyse s, and advanced analytical techniques 
to address these limitations, ensuring that risk management strategies 
are both theoretically robust and practically applicable.  

   52 
7.5 Limitations  
This study, while comprehensive, is subject to several limitations that 
impacted the findings and their applicability, as anticipated in Section 
1.5 and further revealed through the analysis in Chapters 5 and 6.  
First, as indicated in Section 1.5, the study's capacity to capture actual 
implementation issues was restricted by it s dependence on existing 
literature (38 sources) and a lack of real -time data or case studies. For 
example, while technology adoption (e.g., BIM) was highlighted as a 
crucial mitigation technique, hurdles like as training costs or opposition 
to adoption we re not investigated, thereby overestimating its practicality 
in real -world scenarios.  
Second, Section 1.5 mentioned that stakeholder feedback was lacking, 
and hence limited the usefulness of the study’s findings.  Although 
stakeholder misalignment and its effects on risk management were 
considered, further insight would have been enriched had project 
managers or contractors been directly included as a source of findings 
to these challenges (e.g. poor coordination).  
Third, Section 1.5 notes the magnitude of geography that was the 
study's focus, thereby restricting its local applicability to special regional 
types of projects. Political Risks, reported as 6.5% in Section 5.1, like 
the example "Political unpredictability delays international construction 
projec ts" by Ullah et al. (2024), can differ a lot depending on the political 
environment. These include areas like conflict zones or stable regions, 
though this research did not examine such distinctions.  
Fourth, the keyword -based categorization approach result ed in a high 
proportion of "Other Risks" (29.0%), confirming the limitation noted in 
Section 1.5 that emerging risks like technological disruptions or 
geopolitical tensions may not be fully addressed. This suggests that the 
predefined keyword dictionary wa s not comprehensive enough to 

   53 
capture nuanced or evolving risks, such as those related to cybersecurity 
or global supply chain disruptions.  
Fifth, the topic modeling in Section 5.3 labeled Topic 3 as "Other 
Mitigation Strategy," indicating a need for more granular themes to fully 
capture the diversity of mitigation strategies, a limitation that emerged 
during the analysis and aligns with the methodological constraints noted 
in Section 1.5.  
Finally, the qualitative approach and focus on large -scale projects,  as 
anticipated in Section 1.5, limit the generalizability of the findings to 
smaller projects or those with different stakeholder dynamics. For 
instance, simpler approaches could be more practical for smaller 
projects with less resources, making the empha sis on methodical 
frameworks less useful. These drawbacks show that researching risk 
management in building projects requires a more comprehensive and 
useful methodology.  
7.6 Recommendations for Future Works  
The following suggestions are put up for further  study in order to build 
on the present findings and overcome the limitations mentioned in 
Section 7.5:  
Incorporate Real -Time Data and Stakeholder Feedback:  Future 
studies should include primary data through case studies, surveys, or 
interviews with stakeh olders (e.g., project managers, contractors) to 
validate literature -based findings and capture practical implementation 
challenges. Exploring impediments to BIM adoption, such as training 
costs or opposition, might offer practitioners with practical insigh ts while 
also addressing the lack of stakeholder feedback mentioned in Section 
1.5. 
Region -Specific Analysis:  To overcome the geographical limitation, 
future research could focus on specific regions with unique conditions, 

   54 
such as conflict zones or emerging economies, to assess how Political 
Risks and other categories vary across contexts. This would enhance the 
applicability of findings to diverse project environments, as suggested 
in Section 1.5.  
Advanced Risk Categorization:  The significant amount  of "Other 
Risks" (29.0%) suggests that better natural language processing (NLP) 
approaches, such as BERT, are required to increase risk identification 
accuracy and catch developing threats such as technology disruptions or 
geopolitical conflicts, as indic ated in Section 1.5. Expanding the keyword 
dictionary to include terms related to cybersecurity, climate change, or 
global supply chain disruptions could further enhance categorization.  
Improved Topic Modeling: The topic modeling technique has to be 
improv ed by making themes more specific, especially when it comes to 
mitigation tactics.  For instance, distinguishing between project 
management and operational strategies within the "Other Mitigation 
Strategy" topic could provide more specific recommendations f or 
practitioners, addressing the methodological limitation of thematic 
granularity.  
Cost-Benefit Analysis of Technology Adoption:  The implementation 
of technology adoption through cost -benefit analysis (fuzzy logic and 
BIM) would demonstrate how these meth ods improve project results 
while decreasing operational risks. According to the generalizability 
limitation outlined in Section 1.5, this would provide practitioners with 
useful information, particularly for resource -constrained endeavors.  
Longitudinal St udies for Smaller Projects: Longitudinal studies that 
look at how well mitigation techniques —like risk identification, 
contingency planning, and systematic frameworks —work over the long 
term in smaller projects may improve the findings' generalizability.  This 
would solve the drawback of concentrating on big projects (Section 1.5) 
and shed light on how flexible these tactics are in various project 
situations.
