Modular Chemical Plants (MCPs) represent a paradigm shift in chemical process engineering. They involve constructing plants from standardized, pre-fabricated modules built off-site. This approach significantly reduces on-site construction time and costs compared to traditional stick-built plants. Key advantages include faster deployment, scalability, and potentially lower capital expenditure. However, module transportation and site integration require careful planning. MCPs are particularly suited for remote locations or projects with uncertain market demands, allowing for phased investment.
