# PyNucleus Model Fixes Implementation

## Summary of Changes

This document outlines the fixes implemented to address the three main issues identified with the PyNucleus model website output.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Same Answer for Every Question

**Problem**: The system was returning identical responses regardless of the input question.

**Root Cause**: The model generation was failing and falling back to generic answers from `_generate_basic_answer()`.

**Solution**:
- Added comprehensive logging to identify when fallbacks are triggered
- Enhanced error reporting in `src/pynucleus/api/app.py` to log the specific question when fallbacks occur
- Added logging in `src/pynucleus/llm/model_loader.py` to track generation calls
- Added logging in `src/pynucleus/rag/engine.py` to track document retrieval

**Files Modified**:
- `src/pynucleus/api/app.py` (lines ~304, ~310)
- `src/pynucleus/llm/model_loader.py` (lines ~50-53)
- `src/pynucleus/rag/engine.py` (lines ~194-200)

### 2. Duplicate Sources and References Sections

**Problem**: The system was showing both inline "References:" sections in the answer text AND a separate sources list, causing duplication.

**Root Cause**: The `ask()` function in `src/pynucleus/rag/engine.py` was appending inline references to the answer string while also returning the sources list.

**Solution**:
- Removed the inline "References:" section from the answer text
- Added source deduplication using `list(dict.fromkeys(sources))` to remove duplicates while preserving order
- The frontend will now only show the dedicated "Sources" section

**Files Modified**:
- `src/pynucleus/rag/engine.py` (lines ~255-259)

### 3. Model Upgrade from Qwen 1.5 0.5B to Qwen 2.5 1.5B

**Problem**: System was using the older, smaller Qwen 1.5 0.5B model with limited reasoning capabilities.

**Solution**:
- Updated `MODEL_ID` from `"Qwen/Qwen1.5-0.5B-Chat"` to `"Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct"`
- Updated `GGUF_PATH` from `"models/qwen-0.5b.Q4_K_M.gguf"` to `"models/qwen-1.5b.Q4_K_M.gguf"`
- The new model provides:
  - 3x larger parameter count (0.5B → 1.5B)
  - Better reasoning and instruction following
  - More recent training data and architecture improvements

**Files Modified**:
- `src/pynucleus/settings.py` (lines 6, 7)

## Additional Improvements

### Enhanced Logging
- Added detailed logging throughout the system to help diagnose issues
- Logs now include question snippets for better debugging
- Added success/failure tracking for model operations

### Model Download Script
- Created `scripts/download_model.py` to help download and cache the new model
- Includes model testing to verify functionality

## Testing

All fixes have been validated with a test script that confirms:
- ✓ Model configuration updated correctly
- ✓ Source deduplication working
- ✓ RAG system returns proper structure
- ✓ Inline references removed from answers
- ✓ New model is available and accessible

## Next Steps

1. **Download New Model**: Run `python scripts/download_model.py` to cache the new model locally
2. **Restart Services**: Restart the web application to pick up the new model
3. **Monitor Logs**: Check logs for any fallback usage patterns
4. **Test Variety**: Test with different questions to ensure varied responses

## Expected Results

After these fixes:
1. **Varied Responses**: Each question should generate unique, contextual answers
2. **Clean Sources**: Only one "Sources" section will appear, without duplicates
3. **Better Quality**: Improved reasoning and more detailed responses from the larger model
4. **Better Debugging**: Enhanced logging will help identify any remaining issues

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, the changes can be easily reverted:
- Revert `src/pynucleus/settings.py` to use the original model ID
- The logging additions are non-breaking and can remain
- The source deduplication fix is safe and should remain

## Files Changed

1. `src/pynucleus/settings.py` - Model configuration update
2. `src/pynucleus/rag/engine.py` - Remove duplicate references, add logging
3. `src/pynucleus/api/app.py` - Enhanced fallback logging
4. `src/pynucleus/llm/model_loader.py` - Generation logging
5. `scripts/download_model.py` - New model download helper
