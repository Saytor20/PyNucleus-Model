Abstract
This paper updates and expands upon a previous study (Int. J. Prod. Econom. 54 (1998) 41) on cost and location
factors used in the US and internationally. The current study includes 43 US cost and location factors and 30
international cost and location factors for 12 countries. In addition, cost scale-up factors for a wide variety of
equipment, plants and processes from air pollution abatement to waste-to-energy facilities are presented. This study
reviews the use of these indexes and scale-up factors, and presents caveats for their use.

1. Introduction
Project planners and estimators frequently ﬁnd
themselves making quick order-of-magnitude esti-
mates of the cost of projects such as the construc-
tion of a new plant or to estimate the budget for a
new Internet startup. If the cost of similar projects
is available, a cost estimator can make adjust-
ments for variables such as time, location and
size. These calculations require the use of appro-
priate cost scale-up and location factors. Cost
indexes measure the cost of a given project rela-
tive to a basis. An inﬂation index typically refer-
ences a base year, which is assigned an index value
of 100. Index values for other years are pro-
portional to the base year in the same ratio as
their cost.
The ﬁrst cost indexes were developed by Carli in
1750 to determine the effects of the discovery of
America on the purchasing power of money in
Europe. One type of cost index is the inﬂation
index, which attempts to adjust costs of similar
projects during different time periods. The en-
gineering news record (ENR) index started in 1909
is the oldest inﬂation index currently used by
engineers (Grogan, 1994). Scale-up factors are
used today for estimating the cost of chemical
plants, air pollution control or waste to energy
facilities, for example.
One of the problems in using cost indexes and
scale-up factors is ﬁnding the most appropriate
data to use. The major purpose of this paper is

to present a large number of indexes categorized to
help the cost estimator locate the correct one to
use. This paper will review the use of inﬂation and
location indexes and capacity scale-up factors, the
different types available, and some caveats for
using them.
2. Cost indexes and scale-up factors
Inﬂation indexes track the change in costs
for similar projects for different time periods.
Location
indexes
are
used
to
adjust
project
costs for different locations. Cost capacity factors
adjust the cost of similar projects of different sizes
or capacities. Through the use of cost indexes, a
cost estimator could use construction cost data for
an oil reﬁnery built in Chicago in 1995 with
capacity X to estimate the cost of a similar oil
reﬁnery to be built in Houston in 2001 with
capacity Y:
Inﬂation and location indexes use a base year
or
location,
respectively,
to
generate
index
values. The ratio of the two values used is
the ratio of their costs. A cost estimator uses
the index values for Project 1 (with known
cost) and for Project 2 (with unknown cost)
to calculate the cost of Project 2. The follow-
ing equation summarizes the use of these two
indexes:
Cost2 ¼ Cost1
Inflation Index2
Inflation Index1



Location Index2
Location Index1


:
ð1Þ
Cost capacity or scale-up factors are used
for estimating the costs of projects of different
sizes. In contrast to inﬂation and location indexes,
the ratio of the capacities of two similar projects
is not usually the same as the ratio of their costs.
Let us assume Project 2 is similar to Project 1,
but has twice the capacity. Usually these will be
economies of scale, such as for chemical plants. In
this case, the cost of Project 2 will be less than
twice the cost of Project 1. Scale-up factors handle
this type of adjustment, as shown in the following
equation:
Cost2 ¼ Cost1

R

There are three cases encountered. The most
common case is when Ro1 and we have economies
of scale (Remer and Chai, 1990a, b, 1993a, b;
Remer and Idrovo, 1990, 1993; Remer et al.,
1994; Remer and Wong, 1996). In a few cases,
such as for single screw, stainless steel extruders
where the R factor is 2.60 (Remer and Chai,
1990b, 1993a) and international airports where the
R factors are 2.90 (Remer and Wong, 1996), there
are diseconomies of scale and R > 1: For modular
type facilities, such as membranes used in water
treatment, R ¼ 1: Combining Eqs. (1) and (2)
above yields
Cost2 ¼ Cost1

(1996).
3. Different types of cost and scale-up factors
Cost indexes can be categorized by compiler
intent, measured cost, industry or location. Com-
pilers use cost indexes for: contractor price,
valuations and general or special purposes. Con-
tractor price indexes measure the change in selling
prices of various types of buildings, such as the
Turner general building index. Valuation indexes
represent replacement costs, such as the Marshall
and Swift industrial equipment index. General-
purpose cost indexes cover a broad spectrum
of a particular industry of a type of cost, such as
the ENR index for construction. Special-purpose
indexes cover a particular industry, such as the
D.S. Remer, F.B. Mattos / Int. J. Production Economics 84 (2003) 116

--- Page 3 ---
NelsonFarrar Reﬁnery cost index or the Handy
Whitman Public Utilities index.
Another difference between cost indexes is the
type of cost that is measured. Indexes can measure
labor, construction, operation, equipment, com-
modities, and other types of project costs. These
costs can be further subdivided. For example, a
compiler of a construction cost index could
consider engineering, material, labor, and land
costs as sub-costs of construction. Cost indexes
can also be categorized by industry, such as
chemical engineering, manufacturing, or biotech-
nology.
Cost indexes differ by the location to which they
apply. Because cost indexes are usually based on
data from a speciﬁc region, cost estimators should
ensure that the indexes apply to the project
location.
4. Notes on using the listings in this study
Lists
of
cost
indexes
and
scale-up
factors
are presented in Appendices AC. Appendix A
contains cost and location factors for projects
located within the United States. Appendix B
contains indexes compiled with international data.
International indexes for 12 speciﬁc countries are
listed by country name, while those compiled with
data from many countries are listed under the
location worldwide. Appendix C summarizes
references for scale-up factors for speciﬁc industries
or facilities.
Appendices A and B contain the following
information about each index:
 Index name;
 Cost measure;
 Location (Appendix B);
 Industry;
 Compiler
information:
includes
address,
phone and FAX number, email and web
address);

extra
information
to
allow the reader to differentiate between two
indexes and choose the one that is most
appropriate to his/her project.

 Information on references including authors
and publishers.
5. Example
Suppose that in the year 2000, a cost estimator
needed to calculate the construction cost for a new
waste-to-energy facility in location 1, with a
capacity of 2000 TPD (waste disposal capacity
measured in tons per day). The estimator knows
that a similar facility with 1000 TPD was built in
another part of the country, say location 2, in
1995, with a total cost of $70 million. After a
literature search, the cost estimator ﬁnds the
applicable cost capacity factor of 0.90 for waste-
to-energy facilities (Ellsworth and Richard, 1998).
Using the Chemical Engineering M & S Index, she
gets the inﬂation cost factors of 1089.0 for the year
2000 and 1027.5 for the year 1995. From a location
reference source such as Richardsons, she ﬁnds a
ratio of 1.1 for location 2 versus location 1. Using
Eq. (3):
Cost2 ¼ Cost1

Therefore, the estimated rough cost of the new
waste-to-energy facility is $138 million.
6. Caveats
 Inﬂation
indexes
are
statistically
weighted
composite averages, and thus, should only be
D.S. Remer, F.B. Mattos / Int. J. Production Economics 84 (2003) 116
3
--- Page 4 ---
used for ballpark or order-of-magnitude calcu-
lations.
 Inﬂation indexes are usually limited in scope to
a particular industry or industrial segment. As
noted by Miller (1995), the ENR construction
index may be misapplied in the process in-
dustries (Park, 1973). The ENR index was
intended for use with civil engineering projects
involving large quantities of unskilled labor,
which may not be the case for process plants or
process plant equipment.
 Inﬂation indexes measuring similar types of cost
may
be
constructed
of
different
weighted
averages of sub-costs. For example, the Bureau
of Labor Statistics compiles two Employment
Cost Indexes for various types of workers, one
for beneﬁts and the other for wages and salaries
(Monthly labor Rev., 1995). Examining the
cost measured by a particular inﬂation index
and how the index is calculated increases
the probability of an accurate cost estimate
calculation.
 Some indexes do not account for technological
changes in design and construction. As technol-
ogy
progresses,
the
cost
weightings
for
a
particular index can change, which may or
may not be reﬂected by the inﬂation index. For
example, production technology developments
may shift manufacturing costs from labor to
plant equipment. An inﬂation index that tracks
manufacturing cost may not adjust to these
changes. Estimators should always check the
applicability of cost indexes used in their
calculations.
 Inﬂation indexes compare costs for products
that evolve over time. Comparing the costs of a
chemical plant constructed today versus 20
years ago should reﬂect not only the increased
cost of materials, but also the additional cost of
government-mandated
environmental
equip-
ment. Cost estimators should be aware that
some inﬂation indexes do not adjust for these
additional costs.
 Inﬂation index calculations become increasingly
inaccurate as the time interval between data
points is increased, i.e., a 5-year calculation
is usually more accurate than a 20-year escala-
tion.
 Some inﬂation indexes are based on published
list prices (rather than market prices) and time-
averaged labor conditions. These indexes can be
insensitive to short-term economic cycle swings.
 Scale-up factors should only be used in the
capacity range for which the factors were
developed. The factors can sometimes be used
outside these ranges, but the accuracy is not as
reliable. In some very limited cases, the scale-up
factors may change because of different tech-
nology or ﬁeld erection versus factory assembly,
for example.
7. Summary
Inﬂation, location and scale-up factors are
powerful tools in performing order-of-magnitude
cost estimates. This paper reviews their use and
presents about 70 cost and location factor listings
and 9 scale-up factor references to assist estimators
in locating these data. We included an example
calculation using cost, location and scale-up factors.
Caveats for using these factors are also presented.
