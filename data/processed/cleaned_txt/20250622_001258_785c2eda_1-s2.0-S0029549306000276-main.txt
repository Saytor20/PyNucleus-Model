Abstract
The future of all reactors will depend on whether they can be economically built and operated. One of the major impediments to new nuclear
construction is the capital cost due in large part to the length of construction time and complexity of the plant. Pebble bed reactors offer the
opportunity to reduce the complexity of the plant because the number of safety systems required is signiﬁcantly reduced due to the inherent safety
of the technology. However, because of its small size, the capital cost per kilowatt is likely to be large if traditional construction approaches are
followed. This strongly suggests the need for innovative construction concepts to reduce the construction time and cost. MIT has proposed a
modularity approach in which the plant is pre-built in space-frame type modules which are built in factories. These space frames would contain
all the equipment contained in a given volume. Once equipment in the space frame is installed, the space frame would then be shipped to the
site and assembled lego-style. Studies presently underway have demonstrated the feasibility of the concept. Thermal stress analysis has been
performed and an integrated design with the space frames has been developed. It is expected that this modularity approach will signiﬁcantly shorten
construction time and expense. This paper proposes a concept for further development, not a ﬁnal design for the entire plant.

1. Introduction
The capital cost of new nuclear plants is the most signiﬁcant
reason for the lack of interest by the electric generation industry.
Despite the fact that nuclear energy provides an opportunity
to demonstrably reduce global carbon emissions, the cost of
building new plants is a signiﬁcant barrier to their construction.
For nuclear energy to emerge as the energy source of choice,
not only must the environmental beneﬁts be accepted but the
cost must be competitive with alternative sources of energy. At
present, the environmental beneﬁt is not sufﬁciently recognized
nor are the present nuclear plants on the market judged to be
economically competitive.
The new nuclear plants on the market today are large light
water reactors of the so-called Generation III vintage. Gen-
eration III reactors are evolutionary light water reactors already
certiﬁed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission which need
only to be ordered to be built since the safety reviews have been
completed in the certiﬁcation process. These reactors require

emergency core cooling systems that are necessary to prevent
core meltdowns. Such complexity costs money, raises generat-
ing cost and increases construction time.
To deal with these extra costs, vendors have decided that the
best way to deal with reducing the cost of power is to make
the generating stations larger taking advantage of economies of
scale by producing more power in only a slightly larger footprint.
While these economies do work, the larger the plant, the higher
the cost and the longer it will take to build. The expectation is
that with the larger power output, the cost of power will be lower
in the end.
This traditional thinking is being challenged by the MIT
pebble bed project. Rather than relying on the economies of
scale to reduce costs, the economies of mass production will
be used. By building smaller plants with factory built and site
assembled modules, the cost and time for construction can be
greatly reduced. The modular approach being developed by the
MIT design team is also different than what others have called
modular reactors (Westinghouse, 2000). The MIT deﬁnition
of modular is making modules that are either truck or train ship-
pable that can be assembled at the site. Modular does not mean
taking a 1200 Mwe plant and making into four 300 Mwe mod-
ule plants. This ﬂies against conventional wisdom on two fronts
that (1) a small reactor can be competitive and (2) modularity

is determined by the size which is judged to be such that no
serious accidents are possible (German Modul basis for their
high temperature reactor).
The design constraint for the MIT modular pebble bed reactor
(MPBR) is what can be shipped by truck or train. This will limit
the size of the components and ultimately the reactor. The tar-
get size of the MPBR is approximately 250 Mwth based on this
criteria. This means that for a 1000 Mwe nuclear station approx-
imately eight reactor modules will be required that will be built
out as the electricity demand warrants using simple space-frame
type construction techniques to allow for faster assembly time.
The original design concept for the MIT modular pebble bed
reactor was that the time to build the equivalent of 1000 Mwe
of nuclear power should be the same for a single plant and the
modular units (Kadak et al., 1998). This paper will describe the
modularity concept proposed that will hopefully yield a com-
mercially attractive approach for further development.
2. Background
TheMITpebblebedprojectisdevelopingaconceptualdesign
of a 250 Mwth120 Mwe modular pebble bed reactor using an
indirectheliumtoheliumheatexchangergasturbinecyclepower
plant (Kadak, 2000). The basic design parameters are shown in
Table 1.
The MIT modular pebble bed reactor is loosely based on
the South African reactor design as proposed in 1998 in terms
of the reactor core and support systems (ESKOM, 1998). The
major exception is that an indirect Brayton cycle was chosen
for the power conversion system (PCS). It is believed that the
use of an intermediate heat exchanger (IHX) provides additional
ﬂexibility in the design of the PCS as well as ease in mainte-
nance due to a non-contaminated secondary system (Kadak et
al., 1998). The fundamental core design is based on a conven-
tional pebble bed core with a central dynamic reﬂector which is
currently being analyzed in terms of its economic value given
the additional complexity it creates in the fuel handling system
and larger diameter of the reactor vessel. As noted, the basic
design constraint of the MIT MPBR is the size and weight of
the components such that they can be shipped to the site either
by rail or truck and, if necessary, by barge. Shown in Fig. 1 is the
basic reactor vessel with the dynamic column. Table 2 provides
fundamental reactor vessel and core data.
A schematic of the plant operating parameters and conditions
(Wang, 2003) is shown in Fig. 2 . The present design utilizes

three-shaft system is limited to a nominal demonstrated shaft

shaft systemone low speed power shaft driving a generator
and two separate turbo-compressor sets. The basis of this selec-
tion was to limit the shaft power of any one turbine to less
than36 MW(tostaywithinexistingturbo-machinerydesigns).
Additionally, by reducing the length of each individual turbo-
compressor set, it becomes easier to layout the reactor plant as

each shorter shaft can be positioned in adjacent modules, hori-
zontally or vertically.
The intermediate heat exchanger consists of six smaller mod-
ules each with its own containment vessel. This was done to limit
the weight of each module to within the 90,000 kg truck limit.
Additionally, by splitting the IHX up into smaller modules, if
there is damage or failure to a part of the IHX, the smaller module
can be removed and replaced. As the IHX will in all probability
be contaminated by ﬁssion products or fuel pebble debris, the six
module arrangement minimizes the cost of an IHX repair since
the most likely damage would be conﬁned to a single module.
The recuperator is also split up into six modules similar to
the IHX. This enables each recuperator module to be closely
located to a corresponding IHX module, limiting the amount
of piping required between the two. The separate recuperator
modules also permit easy maintenance and ease of replacement,
like the IHX modules.
The balance of plant (BOP) layout shown in Fig. 3 is pro-
posed. This layout seeks to maximize the modularity of the
design by concentrating manifolds and plumbing in individual
modules, while restricting each module to a single type of com-
ponent (keeping turbo-machinery in separate modules from heat
exchangers whenever possible to minimize parasitic effects dur-
ing maintenance).
3. Modularity principles in design (Berte, 2004)
The initial concept for the MPBR was to build all the parts
in a central factory and ship them to the construction site, where
they would be assembled in a simple, bolt together, plug and
play fashion, loaded with fuel and powered up (Mynatt et al.,
2003).
The MPBR project is highly dependent on the ability to
package the reactor, its intermediate heat exchanger, and the
remaining balance of plant in such a way to allow the MPBR
plant to be transported via low cost means (truck as opposed to
barge), easily assembled with minimal tooling and re-working,
and operated in a small footprint commensurate with conven-
tional power plants. Based on this dependency, the following
requirements and design assumptions can be made.

All components other than the reactor vessel and its associ-
ated mechanical support systems must be transportable by heavy
lift tractor/trailer truck. Given that heavy lift trucks are used to
transport the BOP components to the plant location, the follow-
ing limitations must be met. First, the maximum dimensions
of any one module are 8 wide, 12 tall and up to 60 long.
Second, the maximum weight of a single module must be less
than 90,000 kg. Finally, the modules must be contained in a
steel space frame to support the components within and to align
those components with the components in other modules. The
assembly on site of the modules must be limited to stacking the
space frames to align the various ﬂanges and bolting the piping
together.
The modularity and packaging studies performed for the
MPBR project can be broken down into three tasks: (1) system
layout and design (physical layout and packaging of the plant
components), (2) system concept design for increased modular-
ity and decreased cost and (3) advanced component design con-
cepts for future implementation. The ﬁrst task involves deﬁning
the physical layout of the power plant itself and the breakdown of
anytransportationissuesinvolvedinitsconstruction.Thesecond
task involves making high level trade studies of the actual sys-
tem, such as the number of intercoolers, limiting temperatures
and other system parameters. The third task involves search-
ing for advanced component concepts that may aid in the other
two tasks by making individual components simpler, cheaper or
more fault tolerant.
The primary concept that deﬁnes the innovation of this pro-
posed MPBR modularity approach is the minimization, and
where possible, elimination, of the new capital facilities, on-site
construction and labor required to construct a nuclear power
plant. This approach is deﬁned by a new way to examine how
components are built and assembled. In the past nuclear power
plant, construction has been performed almost completely on
site, as most of the components are far too large to transport
assembled. Each new plant was effectively a new plant, in that
it shared little, even in factory plants, with its brethren. These
large plants are also vulnerable to major component failures
which would eliminate all 1000 Mwe+ of generating capac-
ity until the component could be repaired or replaced. Given
the complexity and assembly techniques used for such plants,
repairs could take a substantial amount of time, and require parts
that were not off-the-shelf available.
The MPBR will be built in a virtual factory in which indi-
vidual component manufacturers would be asked to provide
all components, piping connections, electric power connections
and electronics for the volume occupied by the component in
a space designated by a space frame (Fig. 4). These space
frames would then be assembled at the plant site using a simple,
bolt together, plug and play style assembly process. This should
dramatically reduce construction time and costly ﬁeld work.
4. System layout and design
The resulting plant layout can be graphically visualized as
shown in Fig. 5 which is a view from the top of the plant looking
down. The dotted lines that are shown indicate the shippable

space frame modules for this design. The modules are arranged
on two levels which are not shown. This layout is designed to
minimize the number of modules that need to be removed to
access any one module. To ensure this, the only modules whose
replacement would necessitate the removal from the plant of
a functioning module is the lower level manifold module, all
other modules can be extracted either from above for the top-
level modules, or from the side (on sliding rails) for all the lower
level modules.
This layout also simpliﬁes construction of the plant, as the
only large machinery needed to emplace the modules is a crane
to emplace the top-level modules. Given the low lift height and
overhead clearance needed to emplace these modules, such a
crane could be limited to a hydraulic lift carriage, deliverable
by truck, which would grasp each module, lift it to the correct
height, and slide it onto rails built into the lower modules. Using
this type of assembly, the amount of site preparation for the
balance of plant part of the facility is minimal (a suitable pad
type foundation with the proper load bearing speciﬁcations).
The on-site tooling and machinery requirements are minimal
(lift carriage, stud tensioner and ﬂange assembly tools).
Overall, this layout requires the use of 21 modules (not
including command and control or power processing), each of
which is truck transportable (Fig. 6 ).
While this type-speciﬁc module isolation increases the total
number of modules in the system, it limits the amount of func-
tioning components that have to be removed during replacement
of a single component. This is necessary, as the current strategy
for repair of this type of reactor facility is one of replacement
rather than on-site repair. Each module will be built in a cen-
tralized factory and is transportable by truck. Therefore, when
a component fails on site, that speciﬁc module will be removed
and returned to the factory for repair, with an identical replace-
ment module taking its place. This layout also maximizes the
effectiveness of this strategy as each of the IHX and recuperator
modules are identical, thus, a single spare IHX or recupera-
tor module can be used to replace any one of the six original
modules.
While not shown on this layout design, plant command and
control facilities and electrical metering/distribution modules
would be shipped in similar containers and also assembled
on site in a similar fashion. The addition of these modules is

what drove the location of the generator/power turbine mod-
ule to its present location at the lower left of the layout, as
additional power processing modules could be added adja-
cent to it without compromising the removal path of any other
modules. Command and control modules could be added in
two levels across from these modules (adjacent to the turbo-
compressor/intercooler modules).
The largest single component is the reactor vessel which has
been preliminarily reviewed for modularity. While shipment as
a single vessel is possible by barge, to maintain the modularity
approach described necessitates segmenting the vessel into ﬁve
ring segments. The determination of whether the vessel would
be ﬂanges (requiring massive ﬂange sections) or simply ﬁeld
welded would be made in future studies. Juelich has proposed
and tested a cast iron segmented pre-tensioned vessel as a solu-
tion that will also be considered (Bottcher et al., in press).
This paper does not address the reactor system or the core
structures. They would require the same level of assessment
regarding the degree of modularity practical and feasible in
design. Modularization of the fuel handling system, the reac-
tor cavity cooling systems, inventory control systems, etc.,
would follow the same design constraints regarding packag-
ing, shipping and assembly but are beyond the scope of this
paper.

smaller than conventional nuclear plants. With reactor vessel,
such a plant could easily be made to ﬁt within a 38 m  24 m
footprint, for a power density of roughly 0.93 kW/m2. For a
conventional 1 Gwe plant, this power density would require a
facility footprint of 9300 m2. Given that conventional reactor
containment buildings (not including the turbine shed and con-
trol facilities) consume nearly 3700 m2 on their own, this power
density is equal to, if not greater than conventional facilities,
including advanced gas turbine systems.
5. Manufacturing and assembly sequence
This manufacturing and assembly sequence would work as
follows.
A series of subcontractors would be selected for all the var-
ious components based on expertise, cost or the existence of
a stock partfor example, Pratt & Whitney, General Electric,
could be selected to manufacture the turbo-machinery (exper-
tise and existing production capability), and Siemens could be
selected for the circulator and inventory control motors (exis-
tence of a stock part).
Second, as each of the major subcontractors should have
the capability of constructing a standard, low-tech space-frame,
each module subcontractor would integrate their component
into the standard frame along with all of the support equipment
which would be designed with a limited number of inter-module
interfaces.
Third, for those subcontractors without the capability of con-
structing the standard frame, or those that simply do not wish to
do so, any local fabrication shop could be used to construct the
frame and deliver it via conventional truck to the subcontractor.
Fourth, site preparation entailing excavation and concrete
construction creating the rooms for space frames is simple
and could be performed by a chosen local contractor.
Fifth, the transportation subcontractor would transport the
ﬁnished modules (most designed to be either road or rail trans-
portable) to the site where they would be assembled using
minimum tools and equipment. Since the transportation sub-
contractor will move the same parts from the same locations
to different destinations, a substantial learning curve can be
developed as better routes can be mapped, escorts arranged in
advance, etc.
Sixth, when the space frames arrive at the site, they will be
emplaced in pre-conﬁgured locations. The connections of pip-
ing, electrical and instrumentation lines would then be made.
The present design calls for bolted ﬂanges for the piping and
plug type connectors for the electrical and instrumentation sys-
tems. Should it be necessary to assure minimal helium leakage
at the ﬂanges, small weld beads to be used at the ﬂanges similar
to that currently done for submarines. This lego style assem-
bly is illustrated by Fig. 7 which is only used to capture the
visualization of the concept.
Once the plant is in operation, if a space frame (component)
needs replacement, it should be readily available, as the subcon-
tractors will be producing the parts continuously, and the next
one produced will simply be trucked to an old destinationat
low cost since the route has been done many times before.
Fig. 7. Visualization of space frame lego concept.
This process exempliﬁes all of the lean manufacturing lessons
being pursued currently, as it minimizes inventory, maximizes
commonality of interface (common space frame, etc.), enables
the complex component subcontracts to be awarded to large,
ﬁxed-location established companies, while using lower cost
local resources for the simple components and tasks. Observing
advanced modular nuclear submarine construction at Newport
News Shipyard and General Dynamics Shipyard at Quonset
Point, Rhode Island, provides additional conﬁdence that the con-
cepts being proposed are quite practical and have demonstrated
substantial cost savings in the fabrication of nuclear submarines.
6. Construction build-out plan
The construction plan of the MPBR reactor system follows a
stepbystepprocessdescribedbelow,andillustratedinschematic
form.
6.1. Excavation
The ﬁrst step in the construction of the MPBR module is the
excavation of the area for the conﬁnement/BOP building. There
are two possibilities for the vertical layout of the MPBR plant.
First, if it is necessary for the containment structure to be buried
to the level of the top of the reactor vessel for accident heat
transfer concerns, the excavation will go to a depth of 19 m, at
this depth, approximately 9 m of the primary side containment
building will protrude above ground level.
6.2. Foundation/walls
The MPBR conﬁnement building is separated into two vol-
umes, the primary side (containing the reactor, IHX modules and
fuel handling apparatus) and the secondary side (containing the
remainder of the BOP). Each of these volumes is enclosed with
1 m thick reinforced concrete walls and a 2 m thick ﬂoor. This
will provide the necessary protection of the MPBR system from
outside projectiles and contain any pressure buildups caused
by catastrophic leaks. The primary side internal dimensions
--- Page 7 ---
508

are approximately 15 m  15 m  25 m while the secondary side
dimensions are 15 m  15 m  10 m (for the above ground lay-
out). For a fully below grade layout, the two volumes would have
the same height). Given this internal volume, if the entire helium
inventory were vented into the building, the internal pressure
would only increase by approximately 100 kPa (assuming zero
cooling, once cooled, the pressure would only be 25 kPa above
ambient). Not shown in the building layout is the extension of
the two volumes laterally at ground level by approximately 5 m.
This shelf is the loading area where modules are positioned on
a hydraulic dolly to be moved outside of the containment struc-
ture (through a sliding, sealed, concrete door) for transportation.
6.3. Vertical module supports (IHX, manifolds)
In order to facilitate replacement of the IHX modules, a steel
beam structure is erected in the primary side volume that sup-
ports the both the IHX modules and the manifold modules during
normal operation. This structure extends in a stepped fashion
toward the reactor vessel to provide rails to slide the IHX mod-
ules out for replacement. An additional steel beam structure
encircles the top of the reactor module to support the fuel han-
dling modules. The reactor vessel itself is supported by a steel
and concrete ring extending upward from the ﬂoor of the primary
volume. These support structures, along with a shelf-like load-
ing dock structure, are not shown in the illustrations for clarity
purposes.
6.4. Bridge crane installation/requirements
The bridge cranes used to install and replace the various mod-
ules are required to emplace and remove the modules in each
volume. The IHX modules are the heaviest removable modules
in the primary volume, with a mass of 40,000 kg (the reac-
tor vessel is heavier but not intended for removal). A loaded
spent fuel module will have a similar mass. On the secondary
side, the heaviest module is the turbo-generator module which
weighs approximately 300,000 kg. However, the design for a
suitable bridge crane to accommodate the generator module, the
bridge crane can be sized for the next heaviest component, the
turbo-compressor sets, which weigh approximately 45,000 kg.
The turbo-generator module, given its position at the edge of
the layout, with no modules placed underneath it, enables it
to be removed and lifted to surface level using a short span
gantry/bridge crane. This crane will be able to lift the generator
module vertically and move laterally to remove the generator
module from the building.
7. Latest design concept
One of the key issues in high temperature gas reactors is the
ability to manage the high temperatures and resulting system
expansion. The space-frame concept must be able to accommo-
date such movement without inducing large thermal stresses.
To that end a thermal stress analysis has been performed which
necessitated revisions to the basic layout (COADE Engineering
Software, 2002). The space frames will be used to support the

components and piping within the frame and allow ﬂexible
movement of the components. This design has yielded the layout
as shown in Fig. 8.
One of the most difﬁcult alignment challenges is that associ-
ated with common headers and connecting piping in the space
frames as shown in Fig. 9 (Northrop Grumman Newport News
Report, 2002). This can be accomplished by a space-frame
design that allows for positioning of the components to match
components in adjacent space frames.
When this plant is segregated in to plant modules, the resul-
tant plant conﬁguration is shown in Fig. 10. The process of
design and build incorporates signiﬁcant engineering input to
allow for efﬁcient modular construction. Three-dimensional
models of the plants design and construction plan are devel-
oped to allow for system installation on a critical path schedule
to assure that all parts can be ﬁt into the modules at the proper
time.
Shown in Fig. 11 is how this reactor system ﬁts into the plant
structures as previously explained.
One of the most important critical issues is establishing a cen-
tral reference line around which to build and ultimately assemble
the modules. Even with computer-automated design and con-

struction, these reference lines become important to manage
tolerances and assure proper assembly. Having machined parts
as line up connections is going to be expensive. Thus, in the
space-frame design, it will become important to know how
much machining and exact positioning of the components in
all the interfaces between all the space frames will be required
to keep the costs affordable. General Dynamics Corporation has
been a leader in integrating engineering and manufacturing in
the construction of nuclear submarines. General Dynamics has
demonstrated that the degree of labor and cost reduction pos-
sible using modularity techniques compared to the old stick
build approaches. The ﬁrst submarine using modularity tech-
niques was able to reduce by 16% the labor costs. The second
reduced those labor hours by an additional 23% with more
expected as systems and fabrication approaches become more
standardized. This expertise will be required for the imple-
mentation of this concept for land based nuclear power plants
as well.
8. Conclusions
If new nuclear plants are to be built they must be compet-
itive with alternative sources of energy. One of the biggest
disincentives is the high capital cost of new nuclear plants
driven largely by the cost of complicated safety systems and
the long construction period driven by traditional stick build
construction practices which are very site labor intensive. A
new approach to building nuclear plants is proposed that is
based on true modularity in which the size of the plant is
driven by the ability to ship by truck (or train) prefabricated
modules in space frames for lego-style assembly. The analysis
performed to date and the experience of integrated engineering
and manufacturing of nuclear submarines in the United States
strongly suggests that these techniques can be applied to land
based nuclear plants. This would allow smaller sized reactors
to compete on a mass production basis versus traditional
economy of scale large nuclear plants on at least three levels:
cost of power, faster construction and less ﬁnancial risk since
smaller amounts of money are at risk for shorter periods of
time. The small 120 Mwe size of these reactors allows them
to be introduced in developing nations and allows developed
nations to use these reactors to incrementally add capacity
when needed quickly. Should these concepts prove viable, it
could revolutionize how nuclear plants are built in the future.
