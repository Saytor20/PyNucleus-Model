"What is the main economic advantage of modular chemical plants in sub-Saharan Africa?","Cost comparison between stick-built and modular execution in regions with limited infrastructure.","Modular plants reduce total installed cost (TIC) by 25-40 % because fabrication occurs in controlled yards, cutting labor hours and weather delays. Lower on-site civil works and faster time-to-revenue are the primary economic drivers.",economics,easy
"Explain how skid-mounted modules mitigate logistics challenges for inland African sites.","Logistics chapter of the African MCP overview.","Skid modules are dimensioned to ISO-container envelopes, allowing rail or flat-bed truck transport on narrow or poorly paved roads. Pre-installed piping and instrumentation means minimal heavy lifts on site, reducing the need for large cranes in remote areas.",logistics,medium
"State the two key assumptions behind the Chen correlation for heat-transfer coefficients in shell-and-tube exchangers.","Heat-transfer theory section.","Chen assumes fully developed turbulent flow and constant physical properties; deviations (e.g., viscosity variation along the tube) require correction factors.",heat_transfer,medium
"Derive the residence-time equation for a CSTR treating first-order kinetics.","Reaction-engineering basics.","For first-order decay −r_A = k C_A. In a perfectly mixed CSTR: F_A0 – F_A = V k C_A. At steady state, τ = V/F_A0 = 1/k·ln(C_A0/C_A).",reaction_engineering,hard
"List three Cape-Open unit-operation objects exposed by DWSIM that are used in the PyNucleus sim-bridge.","PyNucleus DWSIM integration notes.","The bridge currently interfaces with: (1) 'SimpleDistillationColumn', (2) 'HeaterCooler', and (3) 'MaterialStream' Cape-Open objects.",simulation,easy
"At what ethanol mole fraction does the ethanol–water azeotrope form at 1 atm?","Phase behaviour section of modular-plant manuscript.","The ethanol–water azeotrope forms at ≈ 95.6 mol % ethanol (≈ 89.4 wt %) at 1 atm, boiling at 78.2 °C.",thermodynamics,medium
"What is the typical skid footprint limit (in m²) for road-legal modular sections exported from Durban port?","African logistics white paper.","For over-the-road transport inland, skid footprints are limited to roughly 4 m × 16 m (≈ 64 m²) to comply with South African bridge and axle regulations.",logistics,easy
"Describe the payback period criterion PyVee uses to screen small ammonia MCPs.","Internal screening memo.","PyVee discards projects whose discounted payback period exceeds 4 years at a 12 % hurdle rate; cash flows include feedstock, OPEX, and carbon-tax credits.",finance,medium
"How does modularization influence carbon intensity (kg CO₂ e per t product) in SSA compared with conventional builds?","Sustainability metrics section.","Lifecycle assessment shows modular execution cuts embodied CO₂ by ~15 % due to lower site concrete and shorter construction phases; operational emissions remain similar.",sustainability,hard
"Give the Reynolds number formula used in the von Kármán integral method for laminar boundary layers.","Transport-phenomena lecture notes.","Re = ρ U x / μ, where ρ is fluid density, U free-stream velocity, x distance from leading edge, μ viscosity.",fluid_mechanics,easy
