## 🔧 Configuration

### Alert Thresholds
```python
DASHBOARD_CONFIG = {
    "alert_thresholds": {
        "error_rate": 0.1,          # 10% error rate threshold
        "response_time": 5.0,       # 5 second response time threshold
        "confidence_degradation": 0.2, # 20% confidence drop
        "system_health": 0.8        # 80% health threshold
    }
}
```

### Data Retention
```python
"data_retention": {
    "metrics_hours": 24,    # Keep 24 hours of metrics
    "logs_hours": 12,       # Keep 12 hours of logs
    "alerts_hours": 48      # Keep 48 hours of alerts
}
